<h3>OPENING OF A HISTORIC SESSION.</h3>


<div class="sn">Memories.</div>

<p>There is always something that depresses, as well as
something that exhilarates, in the first day of
a Session of Parliament. In the months which
have elapsed, there have been plenty of events to emphasize
the mutability and the everlasting tragedy of human life.
Some men have died; figures that seemed almost the
immortal portion of the life of Parliament have disappeared
into night, and their place knows them no more; others
have met the fate, more sinister and melancholy, of changing
a life of dignity and honour for one of ignominy and
shame.</p>

<div class="sn">The irony of
the seats.</div>

<p>But no such thought disturbed the cheerful souls of some
of the Irish Members; in the worst of times
there is something exuberant in the Celt that rises
superior to circumstance. This was to be an Irish
Session; and the great fight of Ireland's future government
was to be fought&mdash;perhaps finally. But there was another
circumstance which distinguished this Session from its predecessors.
The question of seats is always a burning one
in the House of Commons. In an assembly in which there
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" class="pagenum" title="Page 10"></a>
is only sitting accommodation for two out of every three
members, there are bound to be some awkward questions
when feeling runs high and debates are interesting. But at
the beginning of this Session, things had got to a worse pass
than ever. The Irish Party resolved to remain on the
Opposition side of the House, true to their principle, that
until Ireland receives Home Rule, they are in opposition to
all and every form of Government from Westminster. The
result was the bringing together of the strangest of
bedfellows in all sections in the House. There is none so
fiercely opposed to Home Rule as the Irish Orangeman. But
the Orangemen are a portion of the Opposition as well as the
Irish Nationalists, with the inconvenient result that there
sat cheek by jowl men who had about as much love for each
other's principles as a country vicar has for a Northampton
Freethinker. On the other hand, a deadlier hatred exists
between the regular Liberal and the Liberal Unionist than
between the ordinary Liberal and the ordinary Tory. But
by the irony of fate, the action of the Irish Party compelled
the Unionists to sit on the Liberal benches again, with the
result that men were ranged side by side, whose hatreds,
personal and political, were as deadly as any in the House.</p>

<div class="sn">Watchers for
the dawn.</div>

<p>As a result of all this, there occurred in the House on
Tuesday morning, January 31st, a scene unparalleled
since the famous day when Mr. Gladstone
brought in his Home Rule Bill in 1886.
Night was still fighting the hosts of advancing morn, when
a Tory Member&mdash;Mr. Seton-Karr&mdash;approached the closed
doors of the House of Commons, and demanded admission
to a seat. For nearly an hour he was left alone with the
darkness, and the ghosts of dead statesmen and forgotten
scenes of oratory, passion, and triumph. But as six o'clock
was striking, there entered the yard around the House two
figures&mdash;similar in purpose&mdash;different in appearance. Mr.
Johnson, of Ballykilbeg, is by this time one of the familiar
types of the House; and, from his evident sincerity, is, in
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" class="pagenum" title="Page 11"></a>
spite of the terrible and medi&aelig;val narrowness of his creed,
personally popular. Mr. Johnson is an Orangeman of
Orangemen. Now and then he delivers a speech, in which
he declares that rather than see Home Rule in Ireland, he
and his friends will line the ditches with riflemen. The Pope
disturbs his dreams by night and stalks across his speeches
by day; and there is a general impression about him that
he is resolved, some time or other, to walk through a good
large stream of Papist blood. He is also a violent teetotaller;
and is so strong on this point that he is ready to shake hands,
even with the deadliest Irish opponent, across the back of a
Sunday Closing Bill. Like most Parliamentary fire-eaters,
he is a mild-mannered man. Time hath dealt tenderly with
him. But still he is well on to the seventies: his hair, once
belligerently red, is thin and streaked with grey; and he
walks somewhat slowly, and not very vigorously. Dr. Rentoul
is a man of a different type. What Johnson feels, Rentoul
affects. He is a tall, common-looking, heavily-built,
blustering kind of fellow; great, it is said, on the abusive
Tory platform, almost dumb and utterly impotent in the
House of Commons. These were the vanguard of the Orange
army, and they proceeded to appropriate the first and best
seats they could lay their hands upon.</p>

<div class="sn">Dr. Tanner
and his
waistcoat.</div>

<p>Dr. Tanner, soon after this, appeared blazing on the
scene; and sorrow came upon him that any of
the enemy should have forestalled him. Like
Mr. Johnson, Tanner is a Protestant&mdash;but,
unlike him, is as fiercely Nationalist as the other is Orange;
and, whenever the waves are disturbed by the Parliamentary
storm, Tanner is pretty sure to be heard of and from.
Viewing the scene of battle strategically, Tanner struck on
an idea which was certainly original. Accounts differ as to
whether he was the possessor of one hat or several; but
tradition would suggest that he had more than one. It is
certain, however, that he did take off his coat and waistcoat;
and stretching these across the unclaimed land of seats, did
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" class="pagenum" title="Page 12"></a>
thereby signify to all mankind that the seats thus decorated
were his. But the novel form of appropriation&mdash;it suggests
a wrinkle to prospectors in mining countries&mdash;was held to be
illegal; and the poor doctor had to content himself with
using the hat, or hats, as a means of securing seats.</p>

<div class="sn">Colonel
Saunderson.</div>

<p>Colonel Saunderson&mdash;another of the Orange army of fire-eaters&mdash;was
early at the trysting-place; and this
brought about one of the curiosities of the sitting.
On the first seat below the gangway sat Dr.
Tanner; on the very next seat, as close to him as one
sardine to another in a box, sat Colonel Saunderson. Not
for worlds would these two men exchange a syllable; indeed,
it was a relief to most people to find that they did not break
out into oaths and blows. What rendered the situation
worse, was that Dr. Tanner has a fine exuberant habit of
expressing his opinions for the benefit of all around him.
At his back sat William O'Brien, with his keen thin face, his
eyes full of latent fire, his stern, set jaw&mdash;his glasses suggesting
the student and philosopher, who is always the most
perilous and fierce of politicians; and to William O'Brien,
Tanner made a running and biting commentary on the speeches&mdash;a
commentary, as can easily be guessed, from the extreme
National point of view. This was the music to which the
Orange Colonel had to listen through the long hours that
stretched between his early morning arrival and midnight.
How men will consent to go through all this travail is, to easy-going
people, one of the curiosities of political struggle.</p>

<div class="sn">The Chamberlain
Party.</div>

<p>Meantime, there had been another and an equally
important descent. Mr. Chamberlain made his
son the Whip of the Unionist Party. The resemblance
between father and son is something
even closer than that usually noticed between relatives. The
son looks a good deal more gentlemanly than the father. But
the single eyeglass&mdash;which no man can wear without looking
more or less of a snob&mdash;is even less becoming to the youthful
Austen than to the parent; and gives him even a coarser air.
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" class="pagenum" title="Page 13"></a>
There is a suspicion that young Chamberlain also came to
the House armed with a goodly supply of hats; at all events,
he and his friends managed to secure a large number of seats
for the Unionists. Chamberlain and his friends sat together
on the third bench below the gangway&mdash;a position of 'vantage
in some respects&mdash;from which they could survey the House.
The first seat was occupied by Mr. Chamberlain; next him
was Sir Henry James, and then came Mr. Courtney, in a
snuff-coloured coat and drab waistcoat; for all the world like
an old-fashioned squire who has not yet learned to accommodate
himself to the sombre garments of an unpicturesque
age. The dutiful Austen left himself without a seat, and
was content to kneel in the gangway, and there take sweet
counsel from his parent.</p>

<div class="sn">Enter the
G.O.M.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, as everybody knows, was not technically
a member of the House of Commons when it
met at the beginning of the Session. He had to
be sworn, and the first business of the House
was to witness this ceremony. I remember the first day I
was a member of the House, and saw a similar spectacle&mdash;it
was in 1880. Then the House was crowded, and there was
a tremendous demonstration; but on the opening day of the
Session just ended, the ceremony came off a little earlier than
had been expected, and the House was not as full as one
would have anticipated. Then there was a great deal of work
to be done; every section of the House was busy with the
attempt to get an opportunity of bringing in Bills. The Irishmen
are always to the front on these occasions, with the list
of a dozen Bills, which they seek to bring forward on
Wednesdays&mdash;the day that is still sacred to the private
member anxious to legislate. The Welsh members have
now taken up the same lesson; the London members are
likewise on the alert. Now, in order to get a chance of
bringing in a Bill, it is necessary to ballot&mdash;then it is first
come, first served. To get your chance in the ballot, you
must put your name down on what is called the notice paper,
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" class="pagenum" title="Page 14"></a>
where a number is placed opposite your name. The clerks
put into the balloting-box as many numbers as there are
names on the notice paper&mdash;they approached 400 on the
day in question&mdash;and then the number is drawn out,
and the Speaker calls upon the member whose number has
proved to be the lucky one. A whole crowd of members were
standing waiting their turn to do this the very moment when
the Old Man walked up the floor of the House to take the
oaths, and there was a great deal of noise and confusion;
but his advent was noted instinctively and rapidly, and there
was a mighty cheer of welcome.</p>

<div class="sn">How he looked.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone walks down to the House, unless on great
occasions. Then there would be an obvious danger,
from the enthusiasm of his admirers, if he were
on foot. Whenever there is any chance of a
demonstration, accordingly, he comes down in an open
carriage, with Mrs. Gladstone at his side. On that 31st of
January, the enthusiastic love of which he was the object,
had several times overflowed; it had brought a huge crowd
to Downing Street, and it had dogged the footsteps of the
Prime Minister wherever he was seen. With bare head&mdash;with
eyes glistening&mdash;with a cheek whose wax-like pallor was
touched with an unusual gleam of colour&mdash;the Grand Old
Man came down to his greatest Session, amid a thicket of
loving faces and cheering throats. I fancy one of Mrs.
Gladstone's heaviest tasks is to look after the clothes of her
illustrious husband. He manages to make them all awry
whenever he gets the chance. He may be seen at the
beginning of an evening with a neat black tie just in its proper
place; and towards the end of the evening the same tie is
away under his jugular&mdash;as though he were trying experiments
in the art of expeditiously hanging a man. But on
these great occasions he is always so dressed as to bring out
in full relief all the strange and varied beauty of his splendid
face and figure. For nature&mdash;in the richness and abundance
of her endowment of this portentous personage&mdash;has made
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" class="pagenum" title="Page 15"></a>
him not only the greatest man in the House of Commons,
but also the handsomest. He was dressed in the solemn
black frock coat which he always wears on great occasions,
and in his buttonhole there was a beautiful little boutonni&egrave;re
of white roses and lilies of the valley. The waxen pallor
was still relieved by the glow caused by his enthusiastic
reception from the people, as, with his son Herbert on the one
side and Mr. Marjoribanks, the chief Liberal whip, on the
other, he walked up the floor of the House.</p>

<div class="sn">The new
Ministry.</div>

<p>One after another, the new Ministers followed&mdash;their
receptions varying with their popularity&mdash;and at
last they were all seated on the Treasury Bench.
In their looks there was ample indication of the
intellectual supremacy which had raised them to that exalted
position. Mr. Gladstone had Sir William Harcourt&mdash;his
Chancellor of the Exchequer&mdash;on his right, and on his left
sat Mr. John Morley, with his thin face and smile, half
ascetic, half kindly. Then came the newest man of the
Government, that fortunate youth to whom power and
recognition have come, not in withered or soured old age, but
in the full prime of his manhood. Mr. Asquith takes his
seat next Mr. Morley; and it is, perhaps, the close proximity
which suggests the strong physical likeness between the two.
Both are clean shaven; both have the long narrow profile that
is called hatchet-faced; in both there is the compression of
lips that reveals depths of strength and tenacity; both have
the slightly ascetic air of the philosopher turned politician;
both look singularly young, not only for their years, but for
the dazzling eminence of their positions.</p>

<div class="sn">Other
groups.</div>

<p>Meantime, there are other groups in the House that are
gradually forming, and that have since played
a momentous part in this great Session. Mr.
Labouchere sits in his old place below the gangway&mdash;a
seat which has become his almost by right of usage,
but which he has to secure still every day, by that regular
attendance at prayers which is so sweet to a devout soul.
<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" class="pagenum" title="Page 16"></a>
Next him sits Mr. Philipps&mdash;one of the younger generation
of Radicals; and then comes Sir Charles Dilke&mdash;very carefully
dressed, looking wonderfully well&mdash;rosy-cheeked, and
altogether a younger-looking and gayer-spirited man than the
haggard and pale figure which used to sit on the Treasury
Bench in the days of his glory. John Burns is up among the
Irish and the Tories, in visible opposition to all Governments.
There is something breezy about John Burns that does one
good to look at. He wears a short coat&mdash;generally of a thick
blue material, that always brings to one's mental eye the
flowing sea and the mounting wave. A stout-limbed, lion-hearted
skipper&mdash;that's what John Burns looks like. There
is plenty of fire in the deep, dark, large eyes, and of tenderness
as well; and all that curious mixture of rage and tears
that makes up the stern defender of the hopeless and the
forlorn and weak. On the opposite side, in the Liberal ranks,
sits Sam Woods&mdash;the miners' agent, who was sent from the
Ince Division of Lancashire instead of an aristocrat of ancient
race; also a remarkable man, with the somewhat pallid face
of the life-long teetotaller, and eyes that have the mingled
expression of wrath and pity common among the leaders of
forlorn hopes and new crusades. Mr. Wilson, the member
for Middlesbrough, is restless, and moves about a good deal.
He has resolved to bring in a Bill to improve the wretched
condition of &quot;Poor Jack,&quot; in whose company he spent many
years of his own hard life; and there is a gleam of triumph
as an Irish member, in accordance with a previous arrangement,
gives notice of a Bill for that purpose when the
hazard of the ballot gives opportunity.</p>

<div class="sn">Mover and
Seconder.</div>

<p>It is an honourable but a painful distinction to have either
to move or to second the reply to the Speech from
the Throne. One of the silly survivals of a feudal
past still obliges men who have to perform this
duty to make perfect guys of themselves, by wearing some
outlandish uniform. Even the sturdiest Radical has to submit
to this process; though I hope when John Burns comes
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" class="pagenum" title="Page 17"></a>
to figure in that honourable position he will insist on retaining
his breezy pea-jacket and his billycock hat. It was
very late in the evening when Mr. Lambert&mdash;the victor in the
great South Molton fight&mdash;had the opportunity of rising; and
it was even still later when Mr. Beaufoy rose. I must pass
over their speeches by saying that both speakers did extremely
well. Even Mr. Balfour had to compliment them;
and the Old Man almost went out of his way to express his
gratification.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Balfour.</div>

<p>It was everywhere remarked that most of the leaders
of parties began the Session in excellent fighting
trim. Mr. Morley has been living in the
pleasant green meadows and fields of the Phoenix Park,
and looks five years younger than he did last year. The Old
Man astounded everybody by his briskness; and Mr. Balfour
also entered on the fray with every sign of being in excellent
health and spirits. There had been a great roar of triumph
when he came into the House, and throughout his speech&mdash;clever,
biting, and adroit&mdash;his party kept up a ringing and
well-organized chorus of pointed cheers. The speech was
a significant departure from the ordinary stamp&mdash;a fact which
Mr. Gladstone, who is notably a great stickler for tradition,
did not fail to notice. For the almost unbroken tradition of
the House of Commons is that the first night shall be one of
almost loving-kindness between the one side and the other.
I remember well <i>Punch</i> indicated this once by representing
Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli beginning a Session by presenting
each other with roses, while behind their backs was a
thick bundle of whips.</p>

<div class="sn">The fray
opens.</div>

<p>But Mr. Balfour is independent of tradition, and demonstrated
it at once with a speech almost vehement,
in part, in its attack. He had a whole host of
flings at Mr. Justice Mathew and the Evicted
Tenants' Commission&mdash;his hits, though sufficiently obvious,
and almost cheap, being rapturously received. Altogether, it
must be said the Opposition were in excellent form, and
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" class="pagenum" title="Page 18"></a>
cheered their man with a lustiness which did them infinite
credit. The Liberals, on the other hand, with forces somewhat
scattered&mdash;the round Irish chorus being especially so, in
the remote distance&mdash;did not seem equally well-organized
from the point of view of the <i>claque</i>. With the dynamite
prisoners Mr. Balfour dealt so gingerly that it was evident he
knew the weakness of the Tory case, and was very apprehensive
that Mr. Matthews would be found to have sold the
pass. The ex-Home Secretary, meantime, was still disporting
himself around the Red Sea or in the Straits of
Bab-el-mandeb; and Mr. Balfour, who has notoriously a bad
memory, was left groping in the cobwebs of his brain, trying
to recollect which of the dynamitards it was Mr. Matthews
intended to retain and which to release. Attacking the
action of Mr. Morley with regard to the liberation of the
Gweedore prisoners, Mr. Balfour brought upon himself a
series of sharp interruptions from Mr. Morley; and there was
some very pretty play, Mr. Balfour retorting now and then
with considerable skill and readiness. Altogether it was an
excellent fighting speech, and a good beginning. There were,
in addition to what I have mentioned, plenty of shots about
the foreign policy of the Government, especially in Uganda
and Egypt; and it is needless to say that Mr. Balfour accused
his successors of swallowing in office all the principles they
had professed in Opposition.</p>

<div class="sn">The Old Man
rises.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone had to stand silent for a few minutes in
face of the thunderous welcome which he received
from the Irish benches. Though the reception was
gratifying, he seemed to be impatiently awaiting
its termination, for he was full of vigour and eagerness for
the attack, and never in his most youthful hours did he display
a greater readiness to meet all assaults half-way. Those
who are accustomed to the Old Man are in the habit of noting
a few premonitory signs which will always pretty well forecast
the kind of speech he will make. If he starts up flurried
and excited, it is ten chances to one that the speech will not
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" class="pagenum" title="Page 19"></a>
remain vigorous to the end; that there will be a break of
voice and a weakening of strength, and that the close will not
be equal to the opening. But when the voice is cold&mdash;though
full of a deep underswell at the moment of starting&mdash;when
Mr. Gladstone moves his body with the easy grace of perfect
self-mastery, then the House is going to have an oratorical
treat. So it was in this initial speech. There was just a
touch of hoarseness in the voice, but it had a fine roll, the
roll of the wave on a pebbly beach in an autumn evening;
and he carried himself so finely and so flauntingly that there
was no apprehension of anything like a loss or a waste of
strength.</p>

<div class="sn">A pounce.</div>

<p>At once he pounced on a passage in the speech of Mr.
Balfour, who had made the statement that such a
policy as Home Rule had always led to the disintegration
and destruction of empires. He rolled out the case
of Austria, which had been preserved from ruin by Home
Rule; and when there was a sniff from the Tory benches,
Mr. Gladstone, in tones of thunder, referred to the speech of
Lord Salisbury in 1885, when he was angling for the Irish
vote, and when he pointed to Austria as perhaps supplying
some indication of the method of settling the Irish question.
This was good old party warfare; the Liberals cheered in
delight, and the old warrior glowed with all his old fire.
There was a softer and more subdued tone when the Prime
Minister referred to Foreign Affairs, speaking of these things
with the slowness and the gravity which such ticklish subjects
demand. But again Mr. Gladstone was in all the full
blast of oratorical vehemence when he took up the attack that
had been made on the Irish policy of Mr. Morley. Now and
then prompted by that gentleman, and with an occasional
word from Mr. Asquith, the Old Man gave figure after figure
to show that Ireland has vastly improved since coercion had
been dropped as a policy. Altogether it was a splendid
fighting speech, and dissipated in a few moments all prophecies
of gloom and forebodings of dark disaster which have
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" class="pagenum" title="Page 20"></a>
been prevalent for so many weeks with regard to the health
of the old leader. Thus in fire and fury began the Session,
the leaders on both sides fully equal to their reputation and
at their best, and all the dark and slumbering forces that lie
behind them as yet an undiscovered country of grim and
strange possibilities.</p>

<div class="sn">Lord
Randolph.</div>

<p>But the solid and united ranks of the Tories were broken
by one figure that was once the most potent
among them all. I had been strangely moved at
a theatre, a week or so before, as I looked at Lord
Randolph Churchill. I remembered him twelve years ago&mdash;a
mere boy in appearance, with clean-shaven face, dapper and
slight figure, the alertness and grace of youth, and a face
smooth as the cheek of a maiden. And now&mdash;bearded,
slightly bowed, with lines deep as the wrinkles of an octogenarian,
he sometimes looks like the grandfather of his
youthful self. It is in the deep-set, brilliant eyes that you
still see all the fire of his extraordinary political genius, and
the embers, that may quickly burst into flame, of all the
passion and force of a violently strong character. For the
moment he sits silent and expectant. He has even refused
to take his rightful place among the leaders of the party on
the Front Opposition Bench. Still he sits in the corner
immediately behind, which is the spectral throne of exiled
rulers. He has the power of all strong natures of creating
around him an atmosphere of uncertainty, apprehension,
and fear. Of all the many problems of this Session of
probably fierce personal conflict, this was the most unreadable
sphinx.</p>

<div class="sn">Reaction.</div>

<p>There came upon the House at the beginning of the
following week a deadly calm, very much in contrast
with the storm and stress of its predecessor.
It is ever thus in the House of Commons. You can never
tell how things are going to turn out, except to this extent&mdash;that
passion inevitably exhausts itself; and that accordingly,
when there has been a good deal of fire and fury one day, or
<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" class="pagenum" title="Page 21"></a>
for a few days, there is certain to come a great and deadly
calm. Uganda is not a subject that excites anybody but Mr.
Labouchere and Mr. Burdett-Coutts; and even on them it
has a disastrous effect. Mr. Burdett-Coutts is always dull;
but Uganda makes him duller than ever. Labby is usually
brilliant; while he discoursed on Uganda he actually made
people think Mr. Gladstone ought to have made him a Cabinet
Minister&mdash;he displayed such undiscovered and unsuspected
powers of respectable dulness.</p>

<div class="sn">Still the
seats.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, there was still room for excitement and drollery
in the perennial question of the seats. Mr.
Chamberlain is not a man to whom people are
inclined to make concessions; he is so little inclined
to give up anything himself; and, accordingly, there
arose a very serious question as to the first seat on the third
bench below the Gangway, which he had taken all defiantly
for his own. He counted without one of the oldest and most
respected, but also one of the firmest, men in the House.
Mr. T.B.&mdash;or, as everybody calls him, Tom Potter&mdash;sits for
Rochdale; he was the life-long friend, and for years he has
been the political successor of Cobden in the representation
of Rochdale, and he is likewise the founder and the President
of the Cobden Club. Every man has his weakness, and the
weakness of Mr. Potter is to always occupy the first seat on
the third bench above the Gangway. Everyone loves the
good, kindly old man, the survivor of some of the fiercest
conflicts of our time, and everybody is willing to give way to
him. When the Liberals were in Opposition, there was a
general desire among the Irish members to take possession of
the third seat above the Gangway; and the first seat has
enormous advantages&mdash;tactically&mdash;for anyone anxious to
catch the Speaker's eye. But whenever the sturdy form of
the member for Rochdale appeared, the fiercest of the
Irishry were ready to give way; and from his coign of
vantage, he beamed blissfully down on the House of
Commons.</p>

<div><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" class="pagenum" title="Page 22"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Strong, but
Merciful.</div>

<p>
Mr. Chamberlain had the boldness to challenge what
hitherto had remained unchallenged; and Mr.
Potter's wrath was aroused. He is not one of
those people who require the spiritual sustenance
of the Chaplain's daily prayers; and, accordingly, it was an
effort to get down at three o'clock, when that ceremony
begins; but his wrath upheld him; and thus it was that on a
certain night, the thin form and sharp nose of Mr. Chamberlain
peered out on the House from behind the massive form
of the Member for Rochdale. It looked as if the unhappy
Member for West Birmingham had undergone a sort of
transformation, and had, like Mr. Anstey's hero in &quot;Vice
Versa,&quot; gone back to the tiny form and slight face of his
boyhood. Mr. Potter, however, is merciful, and having
asserted his rights, he surrendered them again gracefully to
Mr. Chamberlain; and the perky countenance of the gentleman
from Birmingham once more looked down from the
heights of the third bench. It would take Mr. Chamberlain
a long time to do so graceful an act to anybody else.</p>

<div class="sn">&quot;Ugander.&quot;</div>

<p>But on the Monday night nobody need have been very particular
as to what seat he occupied; for nothing
could have been much more dull than the whole
proceedings. I make only one or two observations upon
Uganda. And first, why is it that so few members of the
House of Commons can pronounce that word correctly? Mr.
Chamberlain,&mdash;if there be anything illiterate to be done, he
is always prominent in doing it&mdash;Mr. Chamberlain never
mentions the word without pronouncing it &quot;Ugand<i>er</i>.&quot; Mr.
Courtney for a long while did not venture on the word; and
therein he acted with prudence. It is a curious fact with
regard to Mr. Courtney that when he first came into the
House he had a terrible difficulty with his &quot;h's.&quot; In his
case it was not want of culture, for he was a University man,
and one of the most accomplished and widely-read men in the
House of Commons. But still there it was; he was weak on
his &quot;h's.&quot; He has, however, by this time overcome the
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" class="pagenum" title="Page 23"></a>
defect. Mr. Labouchere talks classic English; was at a
German university; has been in every part of the world; has
written miles of French memorandums; has sung serenades
in Italian; and, if he were not so confoundedly lazy, would
probably speak more languages than any man in Parliament.
But yet he cannot pronounce either a final &quot;g&quot; or allow a
word to end in a vowel without adding the ignoble, superfluous,
and utterly brutal &quot;er.&quot; When he wishes to confound
Mr. Gladstone, he assaults about &quot;Ugand<i>er</i>&quot;; when the
concerns of our great Eastern dependency move him to
interest, he asks about &quot;Indi<i>er</i>&quot;; and he speaks of the
primordial accomplishments of man as &quot;readin'&quot; and
&quot;writin'.&quot;</p>

<div class="sn">Sir Edward
Grey.</div>

<p>Ugand<i>er</i> gave Sir Edward Grey his first opportunity of
speaking in his new capacity of Under-Secretary
for Foreign Affairs. There are some men in the
House of Commons whose profession is written in
the legible language of nature on every line of their faces.
You could never, looking at Mr. Haldane, for instance, be in
doubt that he was an Equity barrister, with a leaning towards
the study of German philosophy and a human kindliness,
dominated by a reflective system of economics. Mr. Carson&mdash;the
late Solicitor-General for Ireland, and Mr. Balfour's
chief champion in the Coercion Courts&mdash;with a long hatchet
face, a sallow complexion, high cheek-bones, cavernous cheeks
and eyes&mdash;is the living type of the sleuth-hound whose
pursuit of the enemy of a Foreign Government makes the
dock the antechamber to the prison or the gallows. Sir
Edward Grey, with his thin face, prominent Roman nose,
extraordinarily calm expression, and pleasant, almost beautiful,
voice, shows that the blood of legislators flows in his
veins; he might stand for the highest type of the young
English official. He has not spoken often in the House of
Commons&mdash;not often enough; but he is known on the platform
and at the Eighty Club. He has the perfect Parliamentary
style, with its virtues and defects, just as another
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" class="pagenum" title="Page 24"></a>
young member of the House&mdash;Mr. E.J.C. Morton&mdash;has the
perfect platform manner, also with <i>its</i> virtues and defects.
Sir Edward Grey speaks with grace, ease, with that tendency
to modest understatement, to the icy coldness of genteel
conversation, which everybody will recognize as the House of
Commons style. This means perfect correctness, especially
in an official position; but, on the other hand, it lacks warmth.
It is only Mr. Gladstone, perhaps, among the members of the
House of Commons&mdash;old or new&mdash;who has power of being
at once, easy, calm, perfect in tone, and full of the inspiring
glow of oratory.</p>

<div class="sn">Pity the
poor farmer.</div>

<p>The agriculturists are not very happy in their representatives.
A debate on agriculture produces on
the House the same effect as a debate on the
Army. It is well known that the party of all the
Colonels is enough to make any House empty; and a debate
on agriculture is not much better. The farmer's friends are
always a dreadfully dull lot; and they usually lag some half-century
behind the political knowledge of the rest of the
world. It would have been impossible for anybody but the
county members to attempt a serious discussion on Protection
or Bimetallism as cures for all the evils of the flesh; but that
is what the agricultural members succeeded in doing on a
certain Monday and Tuesday night. Their prosings were
perhaps welcome to the House; but it was a curious thing to
see an assembly, as yet in its very infancy, so bored as to
find refuge in every part of the building, except the hall
appropriated to its deliberations. Mr. Chaplin is always to
the front on such occasions; pompous, prolix, and ineffably
dull. Mr. Herbert Gardner made his d&eacute;but as the Minister
for Agriculture, and did it excellently.</p>

<div class="sn">Keir-Hardie.</div>

<p>Mr. Keir-Hardie is certainly one of the most curious forms
which have yet appeared on the Parliamentary
horizon. He wears a small cap&mdash;such as you see
on men when they are travelling; a short sack coat; a pair
of trousers of a somewhat wild and pronounced whiteish hue;
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" class="pagenum" title="Page 25"></a>
and his beard is unkempt and almost conceals his entire face.
The eyes are deep-set, restless, grey&mdash;with strange lights as
of fanaticism, or dreams. He rather pleasantly surprised the
House by his style of speech. Something wild in a harsh
shriek was what was looked for; but the wildest of Scotchmen
has the redeeming sense and canniness of his race&mdash;always
excepting Mr. Cunninghame Graham, whose Scotch blood
was infused with a large mixture of the wild tribe of an Arab
ancestress; and Mr. Keir-Hardie&mdash;speaking a good deal like
Mr. T.W. Russell&mdash;made a foolish proposal in a somewhat
rational speech. But he was unlucky in his backers. The
Liberal benches sate&mdash;dumb though attentive, and not unamiable.
Mr. Gladstone gazed upon the new Parliamentary
phenomenon with interest, but the only voices that broke the
silence of the reception were the strident tones of Mr. Howard
Vincent, of Sheffield, and Mr. Johnston, of Ballykilbeg.
Now Howard Vincent is known to all men as one of the
people who speak in season and out of season, when once they
mount their hobby. The other day I heard of a bimetallist
who was so fond of discussing bimetallism that the railway
carriage, in which he went to town every morning, was
always left vacant for him; nobody could stand him any
longer. Similar is the attitude of the House of Commons to
Howard Vincent. Fair Trade is his craze. He proposes it
at Tory Conferences&mdash;much to the dismay of Tory wire-pullers;
he gets it into the most unlikely discussions in the
House of Commons; and all the world laughs at him as
though he were to propose the restoration of slavery, or chaos
come again. Poor Mr. Johnston only cares about the Pope,
and cheers Mr. Hardie simply as a possible obstruction to Mr.
Gladstone. Ill-omened welcomes these for a friend of Labour.</p>

<div class="sn">Sir John
Gorst.</div>

<p>Sir John Gorst occupies a curious position in his own
party. He is one of their very ablest debaters;
always speaks forcibly and to the point; rarely
makes a mistake; and has a wonderfully good
eye for the weak points in the armoury of his opponents. He
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" class="pagenum" title="Page 26"></a>
was the really strong man in the old Fourth Party combination;
but somehow or other he does not get on with his
friends, and has been left without Cabinet office at a time
when many inferior men have been able to get ahead of him.
He has a cold, cynical manner; suggests usually the clever
lawyer rather than the sympathetic politician; and altogether
seems at odds with the world and with himself. He made a
bold bid, however, for labour legislation; placed himself in a
different position from the rest of his colleagues; and altogether
made one of those speeches which are listened to in
amused curiosity by political opponents, and in ominous
silence and with downcast looks by political friends. Mr.
Balfour's face was a study; but it was a study in the impassibility
which politicians cultivate when they desire to
conceal their hatred of a political friend. It is on the same
side of the House that the really violent and merciless
animosities of the Parliamentary life prevail. I should think
that Sir John Gorst is the object of about as bitter a hatred
among his own gang as any man in the House.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. George
Wyndham.</div>

<p>In the happily-ended coercion days, letters constantly
appeared in the newspapers, signed &quot;George
Wyndham.&quot; A certain flippancy and cynicism of
tone, joined to a skilful though school-boyish
delight in dialectics, suggested that though the name was
George Wyndham, the writer was an eminent chief. When
at last Mr. George Wyndham made his appearance in the
House and delivered himself of his maiden speech, Mr.
Campbell-Bannerman&mdash;one of the wittiest men in the House,
though you would take him for a very serious Scotchman
without a joke in him, at first sight&mdash;expressed his satisfaction
to find that there was such a person as Mr. Wyndham, as he
had been inclined to rank him with Mrs. 'Arris and other
mythical personages of whom history speaks. Mr. Wyndham
is a tall, handsome, slight fellow&mdash;with an immense head of
black hair, regular features, hatchet but well-shaped face,
and a fine nose, Roman in size, Norman in aquilinity and
<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" class="pagenum" title="Page 27"></a>
haughtiness. He is a smart rather than a clever man, but
has plenty of vanity, ambition, and industry, and may
go far.</p>

<div class="sn">Who said
&quot;Rats&quot;?</div>

<p>Mr. Jesse Collings has changed from a respectable Radical,
with good intentions and excellent sentiments,
into a carping, venomous, wrong-headed hater
of Mr. Gladstone and all the proposals which
come from a Liberal Government. On the 8th of February,
he gave an extremely ugly specimen of his malignant temper,
by complaining that there was no care for the agricultural
labourer on the part of a Government which has undertaken
the largest scheme of agricultural reform ever presented to a
House of Commons. This had the effect of rousing the Old
Man to one of those devastating bits of scornful and quiet
invective by which he sometimes delights the House of
Commons. Jesse had spoken of the proposals of the
Queen's Speech as a ridiculous mouse, and thereupon came
the dread retort that mice were not the only &quot;rodents&quot; that
infested ancient buildings; the words derived additional
significance from the fact that, as he used them, the Prime
Minister directed on Jesse those luminous, large, searching
eyes of his, with all their infinite capacity for expressing
passion, scorn, contempt, and disgust. The House was not
slow to catch the significance of the phrase, and jumped at it,
and yelled delightedly until the roof rang again.</p>

<div class="sn">A tumble
for Joe.</div>

<p>This naturally called Joe, pliant creature, to the rescue
of his beloved friend. That, however, was far
from a lucky week with Joe; he had begun to
look positively hang-dog, with baffled hate. He
attempted to stem the splendid tide of enthusiasm on which
the Grand Old Leader was swimming triumphantly, by stating
that at one time Mr. Gladstone had separated himself
from Mr. Collings's proposals for the reform of the position
of the agricultural labourers. When anybody makes a quotation
against Mr. Gladstone, the latter gentleman has a most
awkward habit of asking for the date, the authority, and such
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" class="pagenum" title="Page 28"></a>
like posers to men of slatternly memory, and doubtful
accuracy. I have heard several of the wonderful Old Man's
private secretaries declare that they had never been able to
get over the dread with which this uncanny power of remembering
everything inspired them&mdash;it was awe-inspiring, and
produced a perpetual feeling of nervousness&mdash;as though they
were in the presence of some extraordinary and incomprehensible
great force of nature. It is rather unfortunate for
Joe that nature did not endow him with any bump of veneration,
and that he is thus ready to embark on hazardous
enterprises, in which he oftens comes to grief. When he
made this quotation against Mr. Gladstone, the Old Man
at once pounced on him with a demand for the date and the
authority. Joe was nonplussed, but he stuck to his point.</p>

<p>But on the following day Mr. Gladstone got up and in
the blandest manner declared that he had since looked into
the speech to which Mr. Chamberlain had alluded, and he
found that what he had really said was, that Mr. Collings had
been supposed to have advocated &quot;three acres and a cow&quot; as
a policy, and to that policy Mr. Gladstone had declared he
had never given his adherence. This was turning the tables
with a vengeance. Jesse grinned and Joe frowned&mdash;the rest
of the House was delighted.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Asquith.</div>

<p>The Home Secretary delivered a speech, which in one
bound carried him to the front rank of Ministerial
speakers. It was a triumph from beginning to
end: in voice, in delivery, in language&mdash;above all, in revelation
of character, it was an intoxication and a delight to the
House of Commons. He swept over the emotions of that
assembly like a splendid piece of music, and there was no
room, or time, for reflection.</p>

<p>But there was an aftermath, and then it began to be
hinted that it was the speech of an orator and an advocate
rather than of a Minister, and that it was unnecessarily and
unwisely harsh in tone; it uttered &quot;no&quot; and a &quot;never&quot;&mdash;which
are the tombs of so many Ministerial declarations.
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" class="pagenum" title="Page 29"></a>
The occasion was the motion of Mr. Redmond in reference
to the release of the dynamitards. Mr. McCarthy, though he
strongly disapproved of the motion, was forced to express
regret that Mr. Asquith had closed the prison doors with a
&quot;bang;&quot; and one or two of the supporters and friends of
Mr. Asquith were also compelled to express their dissent, and
to vote in the lobby against him. But undoubtedly that
speech has immensely increased Mr. Asquith's reputation and
strengthens his position. He is one of the strong and great
men of the immediate future.</p>

<div class="sn">Obstruction,
naked and
unashamed.</div>

<p>When the debate on amnesty was concluded, there came a
climax to that system of obstruction in which the
Tories and the Unionists indulged during the
first fortnight; and there was indication of the
growing exasperation of the Ministerial and the Irish
members. Midnight had struck; and Mr. Balfour, on the
part of the Tories, had the face to declare that it was impossible,
at such a late hour, to do justice to the next amendment.
As the next amendment dealt with the Gweedore
prisoners, and as the House has heard of little else
but the Gweedore prisoners for the last fortnight, the
majority received this announcement with a fierce outburst
of impatience, the Irish Bench especially being
delighted at the opportunity of paying back to Mr. Balfour
some of the insults he had poured on them so freely during
his six years of power. Meantime, the Liberal temper had
been roused to still more feverish heat by the splendid news
from Halifax, followed by the even more unexpectedly good
tidings from Walsall; and there was a determination to
stand no nonsense. But Obstruction was determined to go
on, and when it was two o'clock in the morning Sir William
Harcourt declared that he would not persevere further.
There arose a fierce shout of disappointment from his
supporters and from the Irishry; but Sir William beamed
pleasantly, and the majority submitted to the
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;tryanny&quot; in the original text">tyranny</ins> of the
minority. And thus debating impracticable proposals, barely
<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" class="pagenum" title="Page 30"></a>
listening to long speeches, doing absolutely nothing, the days
succeeded each other; and legislators who wanted work,
longed for the steady and mechanical regularity of their well-ordered
offices, their vast factories, their sanely-conducted
communications with all parts of the world, to which English
genius, sense, and industry have brought the goods of
England. The contrast between the Englishman at business
and at politics is exasperating, woeful, tragic.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II" />CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>THE HOME RULE BILL.</h3>


<div class="sn">I remember.</div>

<p>When I saw Mr. Gladstone take his seat in the House of
Commons on February 13th, I was irresistibly
reminded of two scenes in my memory. One
took place in Cork some twelve years ago. Mr. Parnell had
made his entry into the city, and the occasion was one of a
triumph such as an Emperor might have envied. The
streets were impassable with crowds; every window had its
full contingent; the people had got on the roofs. It almost
seemed, as one of Mr. Parnell's friends and supporters
declared, as if every brick were a human face. Men shouted
themselves hoarse; young women waved their handkerchiefs
till their arms must have ached; old women rushed down
before the horses of the great Leader's carriage, and kissed
the dust over which he passed. And, then, when it was all
over, Mr. Parnell had to sit in a small room, listening to the
complaints and most inconvenient cross-questionings of an
extremely pragmatical supporter, who would have been an
affliction to any man from the intensity and tenacity of his
powers of boring. As I looked at poor Parnell, with that
deprecatory smile of his which so often lit up the flint-like
hardness, the terrible resolution of his face&mdash;as varied in its
lights and shadows as a lake under an April sky&mdash;I thought
of the contrast there was between the small annoyances, the
squalid cares of even the greatest leaders of men and the
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" class="pagenum" title="Page 32"></a>
brave outward show of their reception by the masses. And
the other scene of which I thought, was the appearance of
Mr. Irving on a first night in some big play, say, like
&quot;Lear.&quot; All the public know is that the actor is there, on
the stage, to pronounce his kingly speech; but, before he
has got there, Mr. Irving, perhaps, has had the sleepless
nights which are required in thinking out the smallest details
of his business; perchance, the second before he looks down
on that wild pit, and up at that huge gallery, which are
ready either to acclaim or devour him, he has been in the
midst of a furious dispute about the price of tallow candles,
or the delinquencies of the property-master.</p>

<div class="sn">Tired eyelids
upon tired
eyes.</div>

<p>So I thought, as I looked on Mr. Gladstone. For there
was that in his face to suggest sleepless vigils,
hard-fought fights&mdash;perhaps, small and irritating
worries. Before that great moment, there had
been consultations, negotiations, Cabinet Councils&mdash;perchance,
long and not easy discussion of details, settlement
of differences, composure of all those personal frictions and
collisions which are inevitable in the treadmill of political
life. Yes; it was the case of the actor-manager with the
thousand and one details of outside work to attend to, as
well as the great and swelling piece of magnificent work for
which the great outside world alone cared&mdash;of which it alone
knew. To anybody who knows politics from the inside comes
ever some such haunting thought about the splendour and
glory of popular receptions and public appearances. I must
confess that I could not get rid of that impression when I
looked on Mr. Gladstone on that Monday night. A deadlier
pallor than usual had settled on that face which always has
all the beautiful shade, as well as the fine texture of smooth
ivory. There was a drawn, wearied look about the usually
large, open, brilliant eyes&mdash;that rapt and far-off gaze which
is always Mr. Gladstone's expression when his mind and
heart are full. There are two kinds of excitement and
excitability. The man who bursts into laughter, or shouts,
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" class="pagenum" title="Page 33"></a>
or tears, suffers less from his overstrained nerves than he
whose face is placid while within are mingled all the rage,
and terror, and tumult of great thoughts, and passions, and
hopes. It struck me that Mr. Gladstone was the victim of
suppressed excitement and overstrained nerves, and that it
was only the splendid masculine will, the great strength of
his fine physique, which kept him up so well.</p>

<div class="sn">The sudden
awakening.</div>

<p>Pallid, heavy-eyed, in a far-off dream&mdash;with all the world
gazing upon him with painful concentration of
attention and fixed stare&mdash;the Great Old Man
sate, keeper still of the greatest and most
momentous secret of his time, and about to make an appearance
more historic, far-reaching, immortal, than any yet in
his career. So, doubtless, he would have liked to remain for
a long time still; but, with a start, he woke up, put his
hands to his ear, as is his wont in these latter days when his
hearing is not what it used to be, looked to the Speaker, and
then to Mr. John Morley, and found that, all at once,
without one moment's preparation, he had been called upon
by the Speaker to enter on his great and perilous task.
What had happened was this: The Irish members had put
a number of questions on the notice-paper, but, anxious in
every way to spare the Old Man, they quietly left the questions
unasked; and so, when, as he thought, there was still
a whole lot of preliminary business to go through, all was
over, and the way was quite clear for his start. &quot;The First
Lord of the Treasury;&quot; so spoke the Speaker&mdash;almost
softly&mdash;and, in a moment, when he had realized what had
taken place, the Old Man was upright, and the Liberal and
Irish members were on their feet, waving their hats, cheering
themselves hoarse. And yet an undercurrent and audible
note of anxiety ran through all the enthusiasm. The honeymoon
of Home Rule is over, and, curiously enough, the very
sense of a great victory after a long struggle has always
about it a solemnity too sad for tears, too deep for joy. The
Liberals and the Irishry stood up; but, even at that hour,
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" class="pagenum" title="Page 34"></a>
there were evidences of the fissures and chasms which the
two great political disruptions-the disruption in the English
Liberal and in the Irish party&mdash;have produced. On the
third bench below the Gangway sate the Liberal Unionists,
Mr. Gladstone's deadliest foes, with pallid-faced, perky-nosed,
malignant Chamberlain at their head, the face distorted by
the baffled hate, the accumulated venom of all these years
of failure, apostasy, and outlawry. Not one of the renegade
Liberals stood up, and there they sate, a solid mass of hatred
and rancour. On the Irish side, Mr. Redmond and the few
Parnellites kept up the tradition of their dead leader in his
last years of distrust and dislike of Mr. Gladstone by also
remaining seated.</p>

<div class="sn">The speech.</div>

<p>The first notes of the Old Man suggested he was in
excellent form. It is always easy for those who
are well acquainted with him to know when the
Old Man is going to make a great, and when he will deliver
only a moderately good speech. If he is going to do splendidly
the tone at the start is very calm, the delivery is
measured, the sentences are long, and break on the ear with
something of the long-drawn-out slowness of the Alexandrine.
So it was on this occasion. Sentence followed sentence
in measured and perfect cadence; with absolute self-possession;
and in a voice not unduly pitched. And yet
there were those traces of fatigue to which I have alluded,
and I have since heard that one of the few occasions in his
life when Mr. Gladstone had a sleepless night was on the
night before he introduced his second great Home Rule Bill.
And it should be added that, stirring and eloquent as were
the opening sentences, they were not listened to by the
House with that extraordinary enthusiasm which, on other
occasions, sentences of this splendid eloquence would have
elicited. For what really the House wanted to learn was the
great enigma which had been kept for seven long years&mdash;in
spite of protests, hypocritical appeals, and, ofttimes, tedious
remonstrance from over-zealous and over-fussy friends.</p>

<div><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" class="pagenum" title="Page 35"></a></div>
<div class="sn">The Bill.</div>

<p>By the time Mr. Gladstone had got to the Bill, he had
exhausted a good deal of his stock of voice, and
yet he seemed to be less dependent than usual on
the mysterious compound which Mrs. Gladstone mixes with
her own wifely hand for those solemn occasions. It appeared
that both she and her husband had somewhat dreaded the
ordeal. The bottle which Mr. Gladstone usually brings with
him is about the size of those small, stunted little jars in
which, in the days of our youth, the young buck kept his
bear's grease, or other ornament of the toilet. But on Monday
Mr. Gladstone was armed with a large blue bottle&mdash;somewhat
like one of those 8 oz. medicine bottles which stand so
often beside our beds in this age of sleeplessness and worry.
Nevertheless, Mr. Gladstone and his wife had miscalculated,
for on two occasions only throughout the entire speech did he
have to make application for sustenance to the medicine
bottle. Another precaution which had been taken turned out
also to be unnecessary. The Premier's eyesight is not as
good as it was a few years ago; and he sometimes finds it
difficult to read anything but the biggest print. For this
reason, elaborate preparations had been made for helping his
eyesight. On the table before the Speaker's chair there was
a small lamp&mdash;somewhat like a student's lamp. This also
turned out to be unnecessary, for the Old Man was able to
read his notes without the smallest difficulty; and the speech
had come to a conclusion long before the hour when the
deepening shadows make it hard to read by the light from the
glass roof of the House.</p>

<div class="sn">The peroration.</div>

<p>At last, the latest details had been given; the Old Man
approached his peroration. By this time the
voice had sunk in parts to a low whisper, and the
deathly hue of the beautiful face had grown
deeper. There was something that almost inspired awe as
one looked at that strange, curious, solitary figure in the
growing darkness. The intense strain on the House had
finally exhausted it, and there had come a silence that had in
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" class="pagenum" title="Page 36"></a>
it the solemnity, the strange stillness, the rapt emotion of
some sublime service in a great cathedral rather than the
beginning of one of the fiercest and most rancorous party
conflicts of our time. To this mood Mr. Gladstone attuned
the closing words of his speech. The words came slowly,
quietly, gently, sinking at times almost to a whisper. What
fantasies could not one's mind play as one listened to these
words. There was underneath the language, the looks, the
voice, the tragic thought that this was a message rather from
the shadow-land beyond the grave than from this rough,
noisy, material world. Imagine yourself in a country church,
the sole visitor in the ghostly silence and the solemn twilight,
with spectres all around you in the memorials of the dead
and memories of the living, and then fancy the organist
silently stealing, also alone, to the organ, and giving out to
the evening air some beautifully solemn anthem with all the
sadness of death, and none of the exultant joy of resurrection,
and then you will get some faint idea of the pent-up emotion
which filled every sympathetic heart in the great assembly as
the Old Man finally came to the closing words of his great
speech. It was not so much a peroration as an appeal, a
message, a benediction.</p>

<p>At first, when the Old Man sat down, the pause followed
that speaks of emotion too deep for prompt expression, and
then once again a rush to their feet by the Irishry and the
Liberals, loud cheering, and the waving of hats, and all those
other manifestations of vehement feeling which alone Mr.
Gladstone is privileged to receive. The Tories had kept very
quiet; had conducted themselves on the whole very well.
Once or twice came a high sniff of disgust, and now and then
a younger member could not restrain himself from an exclamation.
But, altogether, the Opposition was under the same
spell as the rest of the House, and listened patiently to
the end.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Sexton.</div>

<p>I may pass over all that occurred on that Monday evening,
with the single exception of the very remarkable speech of
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" class="pagenum" title="Page 37"></a>
Mr. Sexton. It was well known that Mr. Sexton had taken
a prominent part in laying before Mr. Gladstone
and his colleagues the views of the Irish party as
to what would constitute a satisfactory Bill to the Irish
people; and Mr. Sexton was authorised by his colleagues to
state their views to the House. This he did slowly, deliberately,
without the least attempt at oratory, but in
language extraordinarily lucid, delicately shaded, touching on
points with exquisite art. And what he said came to this;
that the Bill was a good Bill; that in his opinion it could be
accepted by the Irish people as a satisfactory settlement of
their demands; but that in two points it needed careful
watching, and perhaps considerable amendment: the financial
settlement and the future of the Land Question.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Balfour.</div>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition had not, so far, shone in
his new position, and people were not slow in
coming to the conclusion that he required the
stimulus and the strength of a solid majority behind him to
bring out his peculiar talents. At all events, his first speech
following the introduction of the Home Rule Bill was a
ghastly failure. It was listened to in almost unbroken
silence from the beginning to the end&mdash;not that the speech
had not plenty of cleverness in it, the small cleverness of
small points&mdash;but it was badly delivered. It did not seem to
rise to the heights expected on such an occasion; in short, it
was a disappointment. Only once or twice did the Leader of
the Opposition succeed in rousing his friends to even an
approach to enthusiasm. Speaking of the amount of money
put to the credit of Ireland, he declared the Government
admitted they had been beaten in a conflict with the forces of
law and order, and that this was the war indemnity which
had to be paid&mdash;a hit that very much delighted Mr. Chamberlain.
The portion of the speech which created sensation was
that in which he alluded to the use of the veto. It had been
contended by Mr. Sexton that the veto would never be used
unless the Irish Parliament so abused its powers as to justify
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" class="pagenum" title="Page 38"></a>
the use of it. This was an honourable bargain between the
British Parliament and the Irish. To such a bargain Mr.
Balfour declared he and his friends would be no parties.
They would not let the weapon of veto rust in case it were
put into their hands, and so on&mdash;a passage which excited
some enthusiasm on the Tory benches and strong anger on
the Irish.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Bryce.</div>

<p>The real framers of the Bill are understood to be Mr.
Gladstone, Mr. Morley, and Mr. Bryce. No man
in the House of Commons has so complete a
knowledge as Mr. Bryce of the various forms of government
in the world, especially in countries which have the complicated
system that is about to be fashioned under the new
Bill. Mr. Bryce is a professor and a student, and he has
the manner of his calling and his pursuits. Arguing his
case without passion, slowly, calmly, in excellently chosen
language, he can speak on even the most violently contested
measure as though it were a demonstration in anatomy.
So he spoke on February 14th&mdash;making mince-meat with
deadly tranquillity of manner of most of the objections of
Mr. Balfour, and altogether strengthening the position of
the Bill.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Redmond.</div>

<p>A speech which had been looked forward to with even
greater curiosity was that of Mr. Redmond, the
leader of the Parnellites. The Tories had settled
themselves down in large numbers, counting on a great
treat. And undoubtedly the opening of Mr. Redmond's
speech was not auspicious. He thought that some recognition
should have been given to the great dead Irishman
as well as to the living Englishman who had brought the
Home Rule question to its present position. The delighted
Tories, not loving Mr. Parnell, but seeing in this the
promise of a lively and unpleasant attack on the Bill,
cheered lustily, and speeded Mr. Redmond on his way on
the full tide of a splendid reception. But as time went on,
their faces gradually grew longer, and when Mr. Redmond
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" class="pagenum" title="Page 39"></a>
resumed his seat they had come to the conclusion that one
of the strongest foundations on which they had built their
hopes for wrecking the Bill had entirely gone. Summed up,
what Mr. Redmond had to say came to this: that he saw
many grave defects in the Bill; that he was especially
dissatisfied with the financial arrangements; that he didn't
approve of the retention of the Irish members in the
Imperial Parliament; but that, nevertheless, it was a Bill
to which he could give a general support. This speech was
received with great though silent satisfaction on all the
Irish benches; but the poor Tories were brought to a
condition well nigh of despair. And thus, cheered heartily
by both Irish sections and enthusiastically greeted by the
Liberals, weakly fought, feebly criticised by the Opposition
the Bill started splendidly on its perilous way.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III" />CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>A SOBER AND SUBDUED OPPOSITION.</h3>


<p>I have always held that the present Government would first
begin to fix its hold upon the country when it was face to
face with Parliament. It was, during the vacation, like a
great firm that is expected by everybody to do a vast amount
of business, but that has been unduly and unexpectedly
delayed in building its works. A visit to the House of Commons
during the week ending February 24th would have exemplified
what I say. It is true there would have been missed
all the intense fury and excitement which characterised one
of the most exciting and interesting weeks the House of
Commons has seen for many a day. There was a calm, the
deadliness of which it is impossible to exaggerate. But
periods of calm are much more interesting to Governments
than to the public. When there are the noise and tumult
of battle; when the galleries are crowded&mdash;when peers jostle
each other in the race for seats&mdash;when the Prince of Wales
comes down to his place over the clock, then you may take
it for granted that the business of the country is at a
standstill; and that just so much of the public time is being
wasted in mere emptiness and talk. But when the House
is half empty&mdash;when the galleries are no longer full&mdash;when
debates are brief and passionless, then you can reasonably
conclude that things are going well with the Government;
that useful business is in progress; and that something
is being really added to the happiness of the nation.</p>

<div><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" class="pagenum" title="Page 41"></a></div>
<div class="sn">The
humbled
Opposition.</div>

<p>So it was during the second week of the Home Rule Session.
No great diplomats claimed their seats; the outer
lobby was no longer besieged; there was no
longer any ferocity of competition for seats; and
the attendance at prayers visibly relaxed; but all
the time more useful legislation was initiated in the
course of the week than in any similar period for upwards
of six or seven years of Parliamentary time. A good deal
of the progress is due to the sober and subdued spirit of
the Opposition. So long as Mr. Balfour was in power, the
more democratic section of the Tory party was kept
comparatively under; but with his fall came an outburst of
freedom; and men like Sir Albert Rollit, who represent
great constituencies, have been able to freely express their
real opinions. Let me pause for a moment on Sir Albert
Rollit, to say that he is a very remarkable type to those
who have known the House of Commons for a number of
years&mdash;as I have. It is rather hard to make a distinction
between him and a moderate, and in some respects, even an
advanced Liberal. He boasts, and rightly, that he represents
as many working men as most of his Radical colleagues;
and he certainly does sit for a place which is not inhabited
by any large number of wealthy people. Disraeli, with his
Household Suffrage; Lord Randolph Churchill, with his
Tory Democracy, have brought this type of politician into
existence, and now he is with us always. This is the
answer to those who contend that because there will be
always Tories and Whigs, it makes no difference what
changes we make. The answer is Sir Albert Rollit; he is
a Tory, but the Tory of to-day is pretty much the same as
the Radical of a few years ago.</p>

<div class="sn">The Registration
Bill.</div>

<p>The Government brought forward the first of their Bills,
and at once the Tory Democrat showed what he
was. For Mr. Fowler was able to quote opinions
from Tories quite as favourable to reform of
registration as from Radicals, and several Tories stood up to
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" class="pagenum" title="Page 42"></a>
speak in favour of the measure. Opposition was really left
to poor Mr. Webster, of St. Pancras; but, then, everybody
knew what poor Mr. Webster meant, and nothing could better
express the lowliness of the Tory party than that opposition
to anything should be led by the hapless representative of St.
Pancras. The consequence of all this was that the Registration
Bill passed in the course of a few hours&mdash;the debate
illumined by an excellent maiden speech from our John Burns&mdash;delivered
in that fine, manly, deep voice of his&mdash;which
always makes me think of a skipper on the hurricane deck in
the midst of rolling seas and a crashing storm. Even a few
briefer moments sufficed for the Scotch Registration Bill;
and the House of Commons almost rubbed its eyes in astonishment
to find that it had actually got through two great
Bills and was about to listen to a third in the course of one
evening.</p>

<div class="sn">Employer's
Liability.</div>

<p>But so it was; and there verily stood Mr. Asquith at the
box in front of the Speaker's chair introducing the
third great Bill of the Government in the same
evening. Mr. Asquith's grasp of Parliamentary
method increases daily. He is really a born Parliamentarian.
It is certain that he has made up his mind to go back to the
bar when his time for retiring from office comes; it will be
a tremendous pity if he does. Such a man is wasted
before juries and in the pettiness of nisi prius. For the
moment, however, he sails before the wind. With his youthful&mdash;almost
boyish face&mdash;clean-shaven, fair and fresh&mdash;with
his light brown hair carefully combed, school-boy fashion, and
with no more trace of white than if he were playing football
in a school gymnasium&mdash;he is a wonderful example of early
and precocious political fortune. There is in his face a certain
cheery cynicism&mdash;a combination of self-confidence and perhaps
of self-mockery, the attitude of most clear-sighted men
towards fortune, even when she is most smiling. At the outset
Mr. Asquith had to encounter an amendment from Mr.
Chamberlain. It is needless to say that, while the most
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" class="pagenum" title="Page 43"></a>
Radical Government which ever existed is proposing Radical
legislation, the cue of Mr. Chamberlain will be now and then
to &quot;go one better&quot;&mdash;to use the American phrase; and
accordingly here was an amendment from Birmingham which
went even further than the Bill of Mr. Asquith. With gentle
but effective ridicule Mr. Asquith, riddled the Chamberlain
amendment; but for the moment the amendment served the
purpose of delaying further progress with the Bill.</p>

<div class="sn">Another
surprise.</div>

<p>And there was another surprise&mdash;actually a fourth Bill&mdash;also
from the Government Bench; and also proposing
to make a further beneficial change in the
position of working men. Mr. Mundella wanted
to get power for the Board of Trade to regulate the hours of
labour among poor railway men. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach&mdash;who
burnt his fingers over Stationmaster Hood&mdash;rushed up
after Mr. Mundella had sate down&mdash;to claim a portion of
the credit for this beneficial change. Here, again, the
Opposition showed that meekness which has come over its
temper. For six years the Tories were in office, but there
was no Bill. The moment he was out, Sir Michael was full
of the best intentions. But his attempt to get credit for
other men's work was vain; for he counted without Mr.
Bartley&mdash;the gentleman whom North Islington sends to
Parliament for the purpose of impeding all useful legislation.
And that Bill also was delayed.</p>

<div class="sn">The government
and
private
members.</div>

<p>There is always something foredoomed about a night
which ends in a count-out. You can almost feel
its untimely end in the air at the very beginning
of the sitting. There is always a great to-do
about doing away with the privileges of the
private member, but I have never really seen anything like a
strong desire on the part of the House generally to keep the
small quorum together which is necessary for giving the
private member his opportunity. To the uninitiated, it is
perhaps necessary to say that the sittings of the House are
divided into two classes&mdash;what are called Government and
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" class="pagenum" title="Page 44"></a>
what are called private members' nights. Government nights
are Mondays and Thursdays. On these days, the Government
is entirely master of the time of the House. They can bring
on Government Bills and in whatever order they please. On
Tuesdays and on Wednesdays the private member is master
of the situation&mdash;that is to say, until the Government of the
day get leave of the House to take all its time, and then the
rights of private members disappear. On Fridays also the
private member is in possession of most of the time of the
sitting. That is the night on which the Government sets up
Supply&mdash;that is to say, puts down the votes for the money
required for the public service. It is a fundamental principle
of the British Constitution that the demand for money
involves the right to raise any grievance; and accordingly
Supply on Friday night is always preceded by motions in
reference to any subject which any member may desire to
raise. These motions are put on the paper, but so inherent is
the right to raise any grievance before giving money, that a
member is entitled to get up, and without a moment's notice,
raise any question which may appear to him desirable for discussion.
As a rule, however, there is but one question fought
out, and when that is decided the Government of the day is
allowed to go on to the votes for money.</p>

<div class="sn">Parliamentary
Wednesdays.</div>

<p>Wednesday is nearly always occupied with some Bill brought
in by a private member, in which a large number of
other members are interested. It used to be said
that Wednesday was sacred to the churches and the
chapels, and that only a religious debate could take place. This
is still the case to a large extent; for instance, on Wednesday,
February 22nd, they employed themselves at the House in
discussing a Bill in which Dissenters are very much
interested. Then, a division has to be taken at half-past
five, and thus there is a good chance of a practical discussion
with a practical result. The consequence is that Wednesday
sittings are always looked forward to with a considerable
interest, and it is always with a pang that the House gives up
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" class="pagenum" title="Page 45"></a>
the right of the private member to them. A Wednesday
sitting is rarely, if ever, counted out, and, indeed, I believe
there is a rule which prevents them from being counted out
before four o'clock, at which hour the late-comers find it
possible to turn up. Friday sittings also rarely, if ever,
end badly, for the Government is ever in want of money, and
a Government has always forty staunch supporters who are
ready to stay in the House in order to help it to get through
its business. But Tuesday belongs to no man in particular.
The Government don't bother themselves about it, because
they don't have money to get at the end of it: instead of its
being occupied with one Bill, which can raise a definite
discussion, Tuesday has a number of motions on all sorts and
kinds of subjects; and, in short, what's everybody's business
is nobody's; and Tuesday constantly ends about eight
or half-past eight o'clock in a count-out. The Government
delightedly look on; it is an additional argument in
favour of taking away the rights and privileges of private
members and turning them into the voracious maw of the
Government.</p>

<div class="sn">Wales in a
rage.</div>

<p>A curious difference presented itself between the interior
and the exterior of the House on the following day
(February 23rd). Inside, there was for the most
part a desert, yawning wide and drear, except on
the benches which were occupied by the sons of Wales; while
outside in the outer lobbies surged a wild, tumultuous, excited
crowd, eagerly demanding admission from everybody
who could be expected to have the least chance of giving it.
Every Welshman in the world seemed to have got there. I
saw Mr. Ellis Griffiths&mdash;an impassioned and brilliant Welsh
orator who ought to be in the House; my friend, whom I
used to know as Howell Williams, and I now have to call Mr.
&quot;Idris,&quot; as if he were an embodied mineral water, and many
others. The secret was that the night was devoted to the
Suspensory Bill for the Established Church in Wales, and
anybody who knows Welshmen, will know that this is a
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" class="pagenum" title="Page 46"></a>
question on which Welsh blood incontinently boils over.
Terse, emphatic, business-like Mr. Asquith put the case for
Disestablishment on the plain and simple ground that the
Established Church was the church of the rich minority, and
that the overwhelming majority of the Welsh representation
had been returned over and over again to demand Disestablishment.</p>

<div class="sn">The cynical
Gorst.</div>

<p>Sir John Gorst has an icy manner and generally the air
of a man who has not found the world especially
pleasant, and delights to take rather a pessimistic
view of things. His great argument was
that if this Bill were carried, young men would not find
enough of coin to tempt them into the Church, and that
accordingly it would languish and fade away. To such a
prosaic view of the highest spiritual vocation, the unhappy
Tories listened with ill-concealed vexation, and Gorst once
more increased that distrust of his sincerity in Toryism which
perhaps accounts for the small progress he has made in the
ranks of his party.</p>

<div class="sn">Randolph
again.</div>

<p>Throughout the night the debate languished, though there
was an excellent speech from Mr. Stuart Rendel
on behalf of the Welsh party. This was practically
the only speech from that side; for perceiving
that the game of the Tories was to talk against time, the
Welshmen wisely declined to aid them, and sate dumb, unless
when they snorted defiance at some absurd claim or fanciful
exaggeration on the other side. At ten minutes past ten,
however, quite a different complexion was given to the whole
debate by the rise of Lord Randolph Churchill. He had not
yet recovered his old mastery of himself or the House; but
his appearance was very different from what it was a few
nights earlier. There was no longer that constant trembling
of the hands which made it almost painful to look at him;
the voice did not shake painfully, and there was a certain
recurrence of that old self-confidence. But still he was far
from what he used to be. The once resonant voice was
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" class="pagenum" title="Page 47"></a>
somewhat muffled and hoarse, accompanied by a certain
tendency to feverish exaggeration of language&mdash;in fact, the
old Fourth Party methods of almost conscious playing to the
gallery. However, it was a good fighting speech, and the
Tories had been so depressed by the bad speaking on their
own side, and by the solid bench opposite of cheering, snorting,
defiant, but distinctly practical Welshmen, that they were
delighted, and cheered admiringly.</p>

<div class="sn">Olympian
wrath.</div>

<p>The intimates of Mr. Gladstone declare that composure is
perhaps the most remarkable of his many qualities.
In the midst of a Cabinet crisis he would
hand you a postage-stamp as though it were the
sole matter that concerned him. But it is also said by his
intimates that he has possibilities of Olympian wrath which
almost frighten people. He was certainly roused to a passion
by Lord Randolph&mdash;very much to the advantage and delight
of the House of Commons; for during the earlier portion of
the evening, and especially while the speech of Mr. Asquith
was being delivered, there was an impression that he did not
look very happy. It is known that he is still fondly devoted
to the Church, and it was suspected that though his convictions
were settled on the necessity of doing away with the
Establishment in Wales, it was not the kind of work to which
he went with any zest. But Lord Randolph roused the Old
Lion within him, and with flashing eye, with a voice the
resonance of which echoed through the House as though he
were twenty years younger&mdash;with abundance of gesticulation,
and sometimes with swinging blows that were almost cruel&mdash;he
slew the young intruder and wound up the debate on the
Church in a frenzy of excitement and delight among his
followers.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Kenyon.</div>

<p>There came, then, a series of incidents which threw the
House into convulsions of rancorous scorn and
farcical laughter. Earlier in the evening there
had been a speech by Mr. Kenyon. Words fail to describe
the kind of speech Mr. Kenyon delivers. Sometimes one is
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" class="pagenum" title="Page 48"></a>
doubtful as to the sex of the speaker, for he moans out his
lamentations over &quot;the dear old Church of England&quot; exactly
as one would imagine a sweet old lady with a gingham
umbrella and a widow's cap to intone it. Meantime, the rest
of the House is convulsed with laughter, so that there is the
curious contrast of one man&mdash;Punch-like in complexion and
face&mdash;reciting a dirge while the rest of the House are holding
their universal sides with laughter. The anger came when
Sir Henry James and Mr. T.W. Russell were seen to be
fluctuating between the Liberal and the Tory lobby. Joe
wisely found a convenient engagement at Birmingham. At
last Toryism prevailed, and amid a tempest of ironical cheers,
the Liberal renegades went into the Tory lobby.</p>

<p>Then the Tories were beaten by a majority of 56, after
which they tried a little obstruction. But it was promptly
sat upon; the closure was moved; only the solitary and
plaintive voice of Mr. Kenyon rose in protest against it, and
so, amid shouts of laughter and triumph, the doom of the
Welsh Establishment was pronounced.</p>

<h3>THE PERSONAL ELEMENT.</h3>


<div class="sn">Small
jealousies
and great
questions.</div>

<p>It is one of the delights of Parliamentary life that you can
never be sure of what is going to take place. The
strongest of all possible Governments may be
threatened, and even destroyed, in the course of a
sunny afternoon, which has begun in gaiety and
brightest hope; a reputation may grow or be destroyed in an
hour; and an intrigue may burst upon the assembly in a
moment, which has been slowly germinating for many weeks.
Mr. Gladstone had a notice upon the paper on Monday,
February 27th, the effect of which was to demand for the
Government most of the time which ordinarily belongs to the
private member. There is no notice which has more hidden
or treacherous depths and cross-currents. For when you
interfere with the private member, you suddenly come in
collision with a vast number of personal vanities, and when
you touch anything in the shape of personal vanity in politics
you have got into a hornet's nest, the multitudinousness, the
pettiness, the malignity, the unexpectedness of which you
can never appreciate. I sometimes gaze upon the House of
Commons in a certain semi-detached spirit, and I ask myself
if there be any place in the whole world where you can see so
much of the mean as well as of the loftiest passions of human
nature as in a legislative assembly. Look at these men
sitting on the same bench and members of the same
party&mdash;<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" class="pagenum" title="Page 50"></a>perhaps
even with exactly the same great purpose to carry
out in public policy, and neither really in the least dishonest
nor insincere. They are talking in the most amicable
manner, they pass with all in the world&mdash;including themselves&mdash;for
bosom friends; and yet at a certain moment&mdash;in
a given situation&mdash;they would stab each other in the back
without compunction or hesitation, to gain a step in the race
for distinction.</p>

<div class="sn">The dearest
foes.</div>

<p>Between two other men there intervenes not the space of
even a seat; they are cheek by jowl, and touching
each other's coat-tails; and yet there yawns
between them a gulf of deadly and almost murderous
hate which not years, nor forgiveness, nor recollections
of past comradeship will ever bridge over. And look at the
House as a whole, and what do you see but a number of
fierce ambitions, hatreds, and antipathies, natural and
acquired&mdash;the play of the worst and the deadliest passions of
the human heart? Above all things, be assured that there
is scarcely one in all this assembly whose natural stock of
vanity&mdash;that dreadful heritage we all have&mdash;has not been
maximised and sharpened by the glare, the applause, the
collisions and frictions of public life. I have heard it said
that even the manliest fellow, who has become an actor, is
liable to be filled to a bursting gorge with hatred of the
pretty woman who may snatch from him a round of applause;
and assuredly every nature is liable to be soured, inflamed,
and degraded by those appearances before the gallery of the
public meeting, the watchful voters, the echoing Press, and
all the other agencies that create and register public fame.</p>

<div class="sn">Blighted
hopes.</div>

<p>Think of all this, and then imagine what a Prime Minister
does who proposes a scheme which will deprive
some dozens of men of an opportunity of public
attention for which they have been panting and
working perchance for years. Recollect, furthermore, that
the private member may be interested in his proposal with
the fanaticism of the faddist&mdash;the relentless purpose of the
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" class="pagenum" title="Page 51"></a>
philanthropist, the vehement ardour of the reformer. Then
you can understand something of the danger which Mr.
Gladstone had to face. For his motion came to this, that
every member&mdash;except one&mdash;who had a resolution on the
paper which he desired to bring before the House had to be
either silenced altogether or pushed into a horrid and ghastly
hour when either he would not be listened to by a dozen
members, or would perhaps be guillotined out of a hearing by
the count out. Let me further explain, for I wish to make
the whole scene intelligible to every reader. Tuesdays and
Fridays belong to private members as well as Wednesdays,
and on Tuesdays and Fridays accordingly private members
bring forward motions on some subjects in which they are
especially interested. In order to get these Tuesdays and
Fridays, they have to ballot&mdash;so keen is the competition for
the place&mdash;and if a member be lucky enough to be first called
in the ballot, he gives notice of his motion, and for the
Tuesday or the Friday the best part of the sitting is as much
his as if it belonged to the Government.</p>

<div class="sn">Salaried
Members&mdash;
Railway
Rates&mdash;
Bimetallism.</div>

<p>Now several members are interested in the question of
payment of members, and for Tuesday, March
21st, or some such day, there was a motion
down for payment of members. Dr. Hunter
is interested in the new railway rates, and for
Tuesday, March 14th, he had a motion down in reference
to railway rates. Finally, several members are interested
in bimetallism, and for Tuesday, February 28th, a
motion on this subject was designed. What, then, Mr.
Gladstone proposed meant that Dr. Hunter could not propose
his motion of railway rates; that the member interested in
payment of members could not propose his motion; that the
motion on bimetallism could not be proposed; in short, that
these gentlemen, and their motions and their time, should be
swallowed up by the voracious maw of the Government.
This description will suffice to bring before the mind of any
reader the difficulty and danger of the situation.</p>

<div><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" class="pagenum" title="Page 52"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Disappointed
Office-seekers.</div>

<p>I tread on somewhat delicate ground when I tell the story
of the manner in which some members of the
Liberal party utilised this situation. It is no
secret that there are in this, as in every House of
Commons, a number of gentlemen who do not think that
their services have been sufficiently appreciated by the
Minister to whom the unhappy task was given of selecting
his colleagues in office. This is the case with every Government,
and with every House of Commons&mdash;with every party
and with every Ministry. You do not think that the favourite
of fortune whom you envy has reached a period of undisturbed
happiness when he sits on the Treasury Bench&mdash;even
when he speaks amid a triumphant chorus of cheers, or drives
through long lines of enthusiastically cheering crowds. He
has to fight for his life every moment of its existence. He is
climbing not a secure ladder on solid earth, but up a glacier
with slipping steps, the abyss beneath, the avalanche above&mdash;watchful
enemies all round&mdash;even among the guides he ought
to be able to trust. Do you suppose that every member of
the Liberal party loves Mr. Asquith, and is delighted when
he displays his great talents? Do you think that none of
the gentlemen below the gangway do not believe that in their
mute and inglorious breasts, there are no streams of eloquence
more copious and resistless? No, my friend, take this as an
axiom of political careers, that you hold your life as long as
you are able to kill anybody who tries to kill you, and not
one hour longer.</p>

<div class="sn">Powerful
malcontents.</div>

<p>It will be seen at once that a party of malcontents is
especially powerful in a Parliament which has in
hand the greatest task of our time, and which on
the other side has a majority which revolt of even
a small number can at any moment turn into a dishonoured
and impotent minority. Such being the material, a nice
little plot was concocted by which a certain number of young
members, full of all that vague distrust of existing ministries
which belongs to ardent young Radicalism, were to be induced
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" class="pagenum" title="Page 53"></a>
to give a vote against Mr. Gladstone's proposal to take away
the time of private members. And it is reported that one
member of the Liberal party had begun operations as many
as four weeks before Mr. Gladstone's Bill came on, and had
tried to extort a number of pledges, the full meaning of
which would only come upon the unhappy people who made
them when they had endangered or destroyed the best of
modern Ministries.</p>

<div class="sn">The out-manoeuvred
Tories.</div>

<p>I think I have now said enough to explain what I am
going to relate. Mr. Gladstone explained his
proposal; which briefly was, that in order to get
on with Home Rule it was necessary to take the
time of private members. As will have been seen, the
meaning of this would have been to have swept away at once
all the private motions in which members were interested.
When the motion came to be discussed, there was a very
curious phenomenon. Everybody had been reading in the
morning papers the chorus of disapproval in which the Tory
press had been denouncing the leadership of the Tory party,
liberals had been repeating to each other with delight the
verdict of the chief Tory organ&mdash;the <i>Standard</i> newspaper&mdash;that
the Tory party had been out-manoeuvred and beaten at
every point in the struggle, and that the portentous promises
of the recess had been utterly baffled by the superior judgment,
the better concerted tactics, and, above all, by the
unexpected solidity and cohesion of the Liberal party.</p>

<div class="sn">Organized
for
obstruction.</div>

<p>That all this had produced its effect on the Tory party as
well was soon evident. An old campaigner in the
House of Commons can soon tell when a party
has been organized for the purpose of Obstruction.
There is a feverishness; there are ample notes; there is a
rising of many members at the same time when the moment
comes to catch the Speaker's eye. Other indications presented
themselves. Mr. Seton-Karr is, personally, one of
the kindliest of men&mdash;cheery, good-natured, full of the easy
give-and-take of political struggle; but even he himself would
<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" class="pagenum" title="Page 54"></a>
not claim to be a Parliamentary orator. But on February
27th, he, as much as everybody else, must have been surprised
to find that his utterances, which, in truth, were
stumbling enough, should at every point be punctuated by a
deep bellow of cheers such as might have delighted the most
trained and the most accomplished orators in the House.
The House itself was at first taken aback by this outburst of
deep-throated and raucous cheers, and after it had sufficiently
recovered from its surprise discovered that it all came from
one bench&mdash;the front bench below the gangway. On this
bench there were gathered together a number of the younger
members of the Tory party.</p>

<div class="sn">The claque in
Parliament.</div>

<p>At once it was seen what had taken place; the Tories,
stung to action by the taunts of their own press,
had concerted a new system of tactics. And one
portion of these tactics was to introduce into the
House of Commons a phenomenon new to even its secular
and varied experience&mdash;namely, an organized claque. It was
really just as if one were in a French theatre. Uniformly,
regularly, with a certain mechanical and hollow effect underneath
its bellowings, the group below the gangway uttered
its war notes. Beyond all question, recognizable by the unmistakable
family features, it was there&mdash;the organized
theatrical claque on the floor of the British House of
Commons. There were other indications of the transformation
on which the Tories were determined. When Mr. Seton-Karr
sate down after a palpably obstructive speech, Mr.
Bartley got up, and several other Tories at the same time.
Mr. Bartley is not an attractive personality. He has a very
strong rather than pleasant or intellectual face. There is
plenty of bulldog tenacity in it&mdash;plenty of animal courage,
plenty of self-confidence; but it has none of the rays of a
strong intelligence, and not many glimpses of kindliness or
sweetness of nature. It is in the work of obstruction that
one sees temperament rather than intellect in the House of
Commons. Obstruction does not call for very high
intel<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" class="pagenum" title="Page 55"></a>lectual
powers, though, undoubtedly, obstruction can at the
same time display the highest powers.</p>

<div class="sn">Artists in obstruction.</div>

<p>For instance, Mr. Sexton made his first reputation in the
House of Commons by a speech three hours in
duration, which was regarded by the majority as an
intentional waste of time and an obstruction of a
hateful Bill, but which everybody had to hear from the sheer
force of its splendid reasoning, orderly arrangement of
material, and now and then bursts of the best form of Parliamentary
eloquence. But the obstructionist wants, as a rule,
strength of character rather than of oratory&mdash;as witness the
extraordinary work in obstruction done by the late Mr.
Biggar, who, by nature, was one of the most inarticulate of
men. It was because Biggar had nerves of steel&mdash;a courage
that did not know the meaning of fear, and that remained
calm in the midst of a cyclone of repugnance, hatred, and
menace. Mr. Bartley, then, has the character for the obstructive,
and he rose blithely on the waves of the Parliamentary
tempest. But he had to face a continuous roar of
interruption and hostility from the Irish benches&mdash;those
converted sinners who have abjured sack, and have become
the most orderly and loyal, and steadfast of Ministerialist
bulwarks. And now and then when the roar of interruption
became loud and almost deafening, there arose from the Tory
bench below the gangway that strange new claque which on
that Monday night I heard for the first time in the House of
Commons.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. James
Lowther.</div>

<p>One other figure rose out of the sea of upturned and
vehement faces at this moment of stress and
storm. When the Irish Members were shouting
disapproval there suddenly gleamed upon them a
face from the front Opposition bench. It was a startling&mdash;I
might almost say a menacing exhibition. It was the face of
Mr. James Lowther. I find that few people have as keen an
appreciation of this remarkable man as I have. In his own
party he passes more or less for a mere comedian&mdash;indeed, I
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" class="pagenum" title="Page 56"></a>
might say, low comedian, in the professional and not in the
offensive sense. His tenure of the Chief Secretaryship of
Ireland is looked back upon, in an age that has known Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, Mr. Balfour, and Mr. John Morley, as
a sublime and daring joke by Disraeli which belongs to, and
could only happen in an epoch when sober England was ready
to allow her Oriental juggler and master to play any kind of
Midsummer's Night's Dream pranks even with the sternest
realities of human life. Yet sometimes the thought occurs to
me that if he were a little more articulate, or, perchance, if
the time came when a democracy had to be met, not with
bursts of Parliamentary eloquence, but with shot and shell,
and the determination to kill or be killed, the leadership of
the party of the aristocracy would fall from the effeminate
hands of the supersubtle and cultivated Mr. Balfour into the
firm and tight grip of the rugged, uncultured country gentleman
who sits remote and neglected close to him. There are
the tightness and firmness of a death-trap in the large, strong
mouth, a dangerous gleam in the steady eyes, infinite powers
of firmness, inflexibility, and of even cruelty in the whole
expression, not in the least softened, but rather heightened
and exalted by the pretty constant smile&mdash;the smile that
indicates the absence alike of the heat of passion or the touch
of pity, and that speaks aloud of the unquestioning and
dogged resolve of the aristocrat to fight for privilege to the
death.</p>

<div class="sn">What a cruel
face!</div>

<p>&quot;Ah, what a cruel face!&quot; exclaimed an Irish Member by
my side as Mr. Lowther turned back and shouted,
&quot;Order, order!&quot; at the Irish benches&mdash;the good-humoured
smile absent for a few moments, and
revelations given into abyssmal depths. But Mr. Lowther
soon recovered himself, smiled with his usual blandness, and
once more dropped the hood over his inner nature. But it
was a moment which brought its revelations to any keen
observer; especially if he could have seen the answering looks
from a pair of blazing Celtic eyes&mdash;also characteristic in their
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" class="pagenum" title="Page 57"></a>
way of all the passion, rage, and secular intrepidity of the
smaller and weaker race that has carried on a struggle for
seven centuries&mdash;over battlefields strewn with the conquered
dead&mdash;past gallows stained by heroic blood&mdash;past prisons and
hulks where noble hearts ate themselves wearily and slowly
to death. It was as in one glance all the contrast, the antipathies,
the misunderstanding which had separated one type
of Irishmen from one type of Englishmen through hundreds
of years.</p>

<div class="sn">The bond of
the Railway
Rates.</div>

<p>These are somewhat remote reflections from the squat
figure, the harsh and grating voice, and the
commonplace rhetoric of Mr. Bartley&mdash;so far can
fancy and insight lead one astray in that great
stage of Titanic passions which is spread on the floor of the
House of Commons. And what significance of great historic
issues and reminiscences there were in the scene were likewise
lost on Dr. Hunter. To him the universe at the moment&mdash;all
the tremendous destinies on the knees of Mr. Gladstone&mdash;all
the millionfold hopes and hungering longings that were
involved&mdash;were as nought in comparison with the fact that
the motion of Mr. Gladstone deprived him of the opportunity
of raising a debate on Railway Rates. Coldly, calmly, self-confidently,
Dr. Hunter attacked the Government in its
weakest place, and drove the dagger home through the
vulnerable side. The weakness of the position was this:
there was a strong, vehement, and widespread revolt in the
House against the exactions of the railway companies.
Liberal members had on the subject exactly the same feelings
as Tories; nightly a score of questions were asked on the
subject. Altogether, indignation had broken down party
lines, and against the railway companies Liberal and Tory
made common cause. Unfortunately, Dr. Hunter's case had
been strengthened by a somewhat weak yielding of Mr. Gladstone
to a demand for a day on Bimetallism. This demand
had, it is true, been urged upon him from various parts of
the House, including his own, and he seemed to be yielding
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" class="pagenum" title="Page 58"></a>
to a pretty universal demand. But Bimetallism was a craze
with no chance of even distant success, while Railway Rates
were at that very moment urgently calling for redress from
hundreds of threatened industries. It would be seen then
what a dexterous weapon for striking the Government the
selection of the day for Railway Rates was.</p>

<div class="sn">No Tory
Leader.</div>

<p>The Tories ought to have at once perceived the value of
the weapon which a Liberal had thus placed in
their hands. Some of them did so, and, undoubtedly,
if a man with the Parliamentary
instinct of Lord Randolph Churchill had been at their head,
they would at once have made deadly and, haply, destructive
use of the opportunity. But Mr. Balfour was away. Lord
Randolph sate, dark and solitary, at a remote seat, and Mr.
Goschen can always be confidently relied upon to do the
wrong thing. It will be seen presently how he helped to
save the Government it was his duty to destroy. No; the
danger of the situation came not from the Tory, but from the
Liberal benches. There are in the Liberal, as in every party
of the House, a number of young and new members who have
not yet learned the secret and personal springs of action, and
who, moreover, do not at once realize the vast underlying
issues on an apparently small question. To them the Liberal
intriguers against the Government had steadily and plausibly
addressed themselves, and many of them were under the
impression that the question raised by Dr. Hunter would
decide nothing more serious than the special purpose to which
one day of the Session could be devoted.</p>

<div class="sn">A coming
storm.</div>

<p>But anybody with the slightest acquaintance with the
House of Commons would have soon perceived
that matter of much greater pith and moment
was at stake. The Senior Ministerial Whip is
the danger-signal of the House of Commons; and the danger-signal
was very much in evidence. Mr. Marjoribanks&mdash;of all
Whips the most genial, even-tempered, and long-suffering,
as well as the most effective&mdash;was to be seen, rushing
back<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" class="pagenum" title="Page 59"></a>wards
and forwards between the lobby and the Treasury
bench, where, with Mr. Gladstone, he held whispered and
apparently excited conversations. Meantime, there grew up
in the House of Commons that mysterious sense of coming
storm which its quick sensibilities always enable it to see
from afar. There came a sudden murmuring, and then a
strange stillness, and older members almost held their
breaths. From the Irish benches not a sound escaped. In
most Parliamentary frays&mdash;especially when the storm rages&mdash;there
are certain Irish members who are certain to figure
largely and eminently; but on these benches there was a
silence, ominous to those who are able to note the signs of
the Parliamentary firmament. Anyone looking on could
have seen that the silence did not come from inattention or
want of interest, for the looks betrayed keen and almost
feverish excitement.</p>

<div class="sn">Ireland in
danger.</div>

<p>For what was going on was a fight whether Ireland was
to be lost or saved, and lost through the folly,
desertion, or levity of some of the men that had
sworn to save her. Fortunately, the strains of
the most tragic situations have their relief in the invincible
irony of life, and there was a welcome break in the appearance
on the scene of him whom all men know as &quot;Alpheus
Cleophas&quot;&mdash;the redoubtable Mr. Morton. Some men are
comic by intention, some are comic unconsciously and unintentionally,
some men are comic half by intention and half
in spite of themselves. To this last class belongs our Alpheus
Cleophas. He played his part of comic relief with a certain
air of knowing what was expected of him&mdash;you see this
demoralizing House of Commons makes everybody self-conscious,
and one could see that he himself anticipated the
roar of laughter with which the House received his statement,
&quot;I have now a majority&quot;&mdash;by which, for the moment,
Alpheus appeared as the leader of the Government, and a
party which controlled the destinies of the House of
Commons.</p>

<div><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" class="pagenum" title="Page 60"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Mere comic
relief.</div>

<p>Still, as I have said, this was only comic relief&mdash;the jokes,
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;oft-times&quot; in the original text">ofttimes</ins>
mechanical, by which the young men
and women downstairs prepare to pass the time
which is required for the preparation of the great
scene, in which their principals have to enact their great
situation. Still, the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the drama was uncertain.
Mr. Marjoribanks rushed from lobby to Mr. Gladstone,
from Mr. Gladstone to lobby&mdash;and still there hung in the
air the fatal question: &quot;Was the Government going out?&quot;
Ah! think of it. Was Gladstone going to end his days in
baffled purpose, in melancholy retirement, with the great
last solemn issue of his life ended in puerile fiasco and farcical
anarchy, instead of in the picture of two nations
reconciled, an empire strengthened and ennobled, all
humanity lifted to higher possibilities of brotherhood and
concord, by the peaceful close of the bloody and hideous
struggle of centuries? Think of it all, I say, and then go also
in imagination to the door of the House of Commons, and
see a Scotch Liberal fighting for dear life to bring into the
Tory lobby the necessary number of misguided and ignorant
neophytes to bring down this disastrous catastrophe.</p>

<div class="sn">Why no
signal?</div>

<p>Meantime, confusion still reigned on the Liberal benches.
Men were confused, and bewildered, and irresolute,
and frightened, conscience of calamitous danger,
and yet unable to understand it all. And here
let me say that this state of confusion was due partly to bad
leadership. There is a want of cohesion&mdash;on this day in
particular&mdash;on the Treasury bench. Mr. Gladstone, like all
ardent natures, takes too much on himself. He is, of course,
a tower of strength&mdash;twenty men are not such as he. But
the burden cannot all be borne by one shoulder&mdash;especially
at a portion of the sitting when, by a strict interpretation of
the rules of the House, Mr. Gladstone is allowed to speak but
once. Why were these scattered and young and inexperienced
troops not told, by their leaders, of the vast issues involved
in this coming vote? Why were not all the sophistries
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" class="pagenum" title="Page 61"></a>
brushed away, by which the conspirators against the Government
were hiding the real effect and purpose of the votes?
Sir William Harcourt is an old Parliamentary hand; Mr.
John Morley is excellent when a few words are required to
meet a crisis; Mr. Asquith&mdash;keen, alert, alive to all that
is going on&mdash;sits at Mr. Gladstone's side. Why were
all these lips dumb? It made one almost rage or weep,
to see the uncertain battle thus left unguided and uncontrolled.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Goschen
to the rescue.</div>

<p>At last a saviour, but he came from the ranks of the
enemy. Mr. Goschen swept away the network
of cobwebs under which Liberals had hidden the
issues, and boldly declared the real issue. And
that issue was, that Mr. Gladstone wanted time to push forward
his Home Rule Bill, and that the Tory party was
determined to prevent him getting that time if they could
manage it. Where be now the hysterics about private members
and simple issues and small questions? The issue lies
naked and clear before the House. But still victory isn't
assured. Mr. Goschen with his thick utterance, his muffled
voice, his loss of grip and point, has ceased to be listened to
very attentively in the House of Commons; and this speech&mdash;the
most significant yet delivered&mdash;passes almost unnoticed,
except by those who know the House of Commons and
watch its moods and every word. The last and decisive
word has yet to come.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Storey's
contribution.</div>

<p>At the same moment as Mr. Morton, Mr. Storey had
risen from his seat, and demanded the word.
There is a flutter of expectation. On this speech
depended, at this moment, the fate of Home Rule
and the Gladstone Government. What will it say? Mr.
Storey always takes a line of his own; is a strong man with
strong opinions, plenty of courage, not altogether free from
the tendency of original natures, to break away from the
mechanical uniformity of party discipline. Moreover, he is
the chief among that sturdy little knot of Radicals below the
<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" class="pagenum" title="Page 62"></a>
gangway who are determined to make the Liberal coach go
faster than the jog-trot of mere officialism. Will he call
upon his friends to stand by the Government or to desert
them&mdash;it is a most pregnant question.</p>

<p>It is not easy, in the midst of cyclones, to collect one's
thoughts&mdash;to choose one's words&mdash;to hit straight home with
short, emphatic blow. But this feat Mr. Storey accomplished.
I have never heard, in my thirteen years' experience of the
House of Commons, a speech more admirable in form. Not
a word too much, and every sentence linked tight to the
other&mdash;reasoning, cogent, unanswerable, resistless. And the
point above all other things laid bare&mdash;are you Liberals going
to help the Tories to postpone, if not finally overthrow Home
Rule, or are you not? This, it will be seen, is but the
emphasizing of the lead already given by the maladroit
speech of Mr. Goschen. But Mr. Storey, clear, resonant,
resolute, speaks to a House that listens with the stillness of
great situations. Every word tells. The issue is understood
and knit; and now let us troop into the lobbies, and proclaim
to the world either our abject unfitness to govern an empire
and pass a real statute, or let us stand by our great mission
and mighty leader.</p>

<div class="sn">John Burns's
penetration.</div>

<p>Not even yet do levity and faction surrender the final hope
of doing mischief. At the door of the House, as
I have already said, stands a Scotch Liberal doing
the work of Tory Whips, and attempting to capture
young members who have smoked their pipes or drank
their tea, or wandered up and down the terrace by the peaceful
Thames&mdash;all unconscious of the great and grim drama going
forward upstairs. He catches hold of John Burns, among
others&mdash;a sturdy son of the soil ready to receive, as might
be hoped, anything which calls itself sturdy and independent
Radicalism. Over honest John's manly form there is a fight;
but he has a strong, clear, practical head over his muscular
body, and at once penetrates to the underlying issue, and
walks into Gladstone's lobby.</p>

<div><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" class="pagenum" title="Page 63"></a></div>
<div class="sn">The division.</div>

<p>At last the division is nearing its close, and the excitement&mdash;perhaps,
because it is so painfully
repressed&mdash;has
grown until it has almost become unbearable.
Whenever there is a close division like this, several
things happen which never happen on other occasions.
Members gather round the doors of the division lobbies,
listening to the tellers as they count one, two, three, four,
and so on, in the mechanical voice of the croupiers, bidding
the gamblers to play with the dice of death. The Whips
also are narrowly watched to see which return first to the
House, for the first return means which lobby has been
sooner exhausted, and the lobby sooner exhausted is
necessarily the smaller lobby, and, therefore, the lobby of
the minority. Mr. Marjoribanks, who has told for the
Government at the door of the Tory lobby, has returned to
the House first. That's a good sign. But still, if there be
a majority, what is it going to be?&mdash;disastrously near defeat,
or near enough to moral strength as to mean nothing? A
few minutes more have to pass before this fateful question is
settled. Mr. Thomas Ellis&mdash;light, brisk&mdash;walks up the floor
to the clerk in front of the table. Then the numbers are
whispered to Mr. Gladstone. The winning teller always
takes the paper from the clerk. It is Mr. Marjoribanks who
receives the paper, and the Government has won. A faint
cheer, then an immediate hush; we want to know the exact
numbers. Mr. Marjoribanks reads them out&mdash;a majority of
thirty-one. We have won, and we who support the Ministry,
cheer; but our majority has been reduced, so the Opposition
burst their throats with defiant answer.</p>

<p>Then, with fatuous folly, the Tories insist on another
division. Two Irish members, driving straight from Euston
station to the House&mdash;John Dillon and Mr. Collery&mdash;have
meantime been added to the Ministerial ranks. Some of the
mutineers have come back, and the majority rises to forty-two.</p>

<p>And so ended the great intrigue of the Liberal malcontents
against the Gladstone Government.</p>

<div><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" class="pagenum" title="Page 64"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Obstruction
rampant.</div>

<p>The word had gone forth&mdash;the Home Rule Bill was not to
be allowed to pass the second reading before the
Easter recess. The slings and arrows of the
Tory press had at last begun to have their effect,
and obstruction had now been entered upon thoroughly,
fiercely, and shamelessly. The first specimen of it was on
the following Thursday night, when Mr. T.W. Russell took
advantage of an harangue by Mr. Justice O'Brien&mdash;those
Irish judges are all shameless political partisans&mdash;to move
the adjournment of the House. Mr. Morley was in excellent
fighting form. T.W. Russell is a man peculiarly well
calculated to draw out the belligerent spirit of any man, and
the Chief Secretary, though he holds himself well under
restraint, has plenty of fire and passion in his veins. He
let out at T.W. Russell in splendid style, and the more the
Tories yelled, the more determinedly did Mr. Morley strike
his blows. Russell, he said, had spread broadcast phylacteries,
and used his most pharisaical language. At this there were
deafening shouts from the Tory benches of &quot;Withdraw!
Withdraw!&quot; Mr. Morley's reply was to repeat the words
&quot;pharisaical language&quot;&mdash;at which there was another storm.
Then Mr. Morley quietly observed that if he were out of
order, the Speaker was the proper person to call him to
account; and as the Speaker made no sign, the Tories were
reduced to silence. In a few sentences, Mr. Morley made mince-meat
of the whole attack: showing that crime, instead of increasing,
had actually diminished in Clare since he had come into
office, and that Mr. Balfour and coercion had completely failed
to do even as much as he had done. Mr. Balfour made a somewhat
feeble reply. And finally, in spite of a strong whip, the
Tories were beaten by forty-five&mdash;the normal Liberal majority.</p>

<div class="sn">The loosing
of the winds.</div>

<p>But all this was but the preface to uglier and worse work
which was to come later on. Supply is the happy
hunting-ground of obstructives. The questions
there are small, and so easily comprehended, that
even the dullest man can talk about them, and it
requires&mdash;<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" class="pagenum" title="Page 65"></a>as
I have said above&mdash;not intellect, but temperament. For
nearly four hours there was a discussion on an item of &pound;100,
which had been spent on improving the accommodation of
the House of Commons. John Burns, disgusted at this
palpable waste of time, four times moved the closure. Jimmy
Lowther&mdash;who has come wonderfully to the front since
obstruction and general rowdyism has become the order of
the day with the Tories&mdash;instantly turned to John with the
observation that this was not the County Council; whereupon
John promptly retorted, &quot;Nor are you on Newmarket
Heath.&quot; At last, after the waste of these four mortal hours,
the closure was moved, was resisted by the majority of the
Tory party, but, at the same time, was so necessary and proper,
that several Tories voted in its favour, and some disgusted
Unionists actually left the House.</p>

<div class="sn">A criminal
combination.</div>

<p>But even worse was still behind. Mr. Bowles&mdash;a new
and clever Tory member&mdash;was anxious to raise
the whole question of Egyptian policy on a small
vote for meeting the expense of building a new
consular house at Cairo. Thereupon, Mr. Mellor&mdash;as he
was plainly bound to do&mdash;declared that a discussion of the
entire Egyptian policy would not be in order on such a vote.
Pale, excited, looking his most evil self, Mr. Chamberlain
got up to base an attack on Mr. Mellor for this judgment.
There was a delighted howl from the young Tory bloods who
had been obstructing so shamelessly throughout the evening.
Mr. Chamberlain's example was followed by Mr. Balfour, by
Sir John Gorst&mdash;in short, the whole Tory and Unionist pack
were in full cry after the Chairman. The inner meaning of
all this, was the desire to discredit the new Chairman, and
intimidate him, lest he should show a bold front against the
shameless obstruction on which the Tories had resolved.
Mr. Sexton put this point neatly. In view, he said, of the
combined attempt and evident combination to intimidate and
embarrass the Chair&mdash;but he could go no further: for at
once there was a fierce hurricane of howls, &quot;Withdraw!
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" class="pagenum" title="Page 66"></a>
Withdraw!&quot; and &quot;Shame! Shame!&quot; from the Tories and
renegades, which drowned every voice. Tory after Tory got
up; shouts deafening, passionate, ferocious, made everything
inaudible; Mr. Chamberlain, paler even than usual, shouted
with full mouth across the floor; altogether, the scene was
one of almost insane excitement. Mr. Mellor&mdash;gentle,
considerate, conciliatory&mdash;reasoned, explained, expostulated.
What he should have done, was to have named half-a-dozen
Tories, and showed the party of bullies that their day was
past.</p>

<h3>OBSTRUCTION AND ITS AGENTS.</h3>


<div class="sn">The younger
Tories.</div>

<p>Obstruction is a thing rather of temperament than intellect.
The occurrences of the early weeks of the Session
of 1893 fully confirm this view. The Tory party
and the Unionists vowed in their organs, and
proved by their conduct in the House, that they determined
to try and prevent, by obstruction, the second reading of the
Home Rule Bill being taken before Easter. With this design
they came down to the House every evening with a plan of
attack. The consequences were somewhat serious to some
members of the House. I saw young gentlemen suddenly
developing activity whom I had beheld in the House for many
years in succession without ever suspecting in them either the
power or the desire to take any part in Parliamentary debate.
The same gentlemen now rushed about with a hurried, preoccupied,
and, above all, a self-conscious air that had its
disgusting but also its very amusing side. For instance, Mr.
Bromley-Davenport, during the six years of Tory Government,
never spoke, and rarely even made his appearance in
the House of Commons. His voice was as strange to the
assembly as though he had never belonged to it. But this
Session he is constantly getting up in his seat, and he rushes
through the lobbies with the cyclonic movement of a youth
bearing on juvenile shoulders a weight too heavy to bear.
Mr. Bartley is about as dull a fellow as ever bored a House of
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" class="pagenum" title="Page 68"></a>
Commons, and in the last Parliament even his own friends
found him a trial and a nuisance. He has suddenly taken to
making the House of Commons familiar with his voice at
every sitting. Lord Cranborne has been remarkable for the
boorishness and impertinence of his manners&mdash;or, perhaps,
to be more accurate, want of manners. I have seen
him interrupting Mr. Gladstone in the most impudent
way with a face you would like to slap, and his hands
deep down in the depths of his pockets. Lord Cranborne
is now nightly in evidence, and leads the chorus of
jeers and cheers by which the more brutal of the Tory
youth signalize the opening of the new style of Parliamentary
warfare.</p>

<div class="sn">Jimmy.</div>

<p>But of all the things which indicate the new state of
affairs which has arisen, nothing is so significant
as the change in the position of Jimmy Lowther.
People think that I have attached too much importance to
this extraordinary individual, and that he should be taken
simply as the frank horse-jockey he looks and seems. I have
given my reasons for believing that in a crisis Jimmy would
develop a very different side of his character, and that he has
in him&mdash;latent and disguised for the moment&mdash;all the terrible
passions and possibilities of the aristocrat at bay. However,
let that question rest with history and its future developments;
his position at the present moment is very peculiar.
There is a report that the desire of his heart is to sit on the
first seat on the front bench below the gangway, which for
seven years was occupied by Mr. Labouchere, and which for
the five years of Mr. Gladstone's Ministry of 1880 to 1885 was
occupied by Lord Randolph Churchill when he was the chief
of the dead and buried Fourth Party. That seat is the natural
point for a sharpshooter and guerilla warrior. Indeed, the
first seat below the gangway seems just as marked out by
fate for such a man as Jimmy Lowther, as one of the high
fortresses on the Rhine for the work of the bold freebooter of
the Middle Ages. But for some reason or other, Jimmy did
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" class="pagenum" title="Page 69"></a>
not attain his heart's desire, and he is compelled to sit on the
front Opposition bench. This would not seem an affliction to
ordinary men. Indeed, the desire to sit on one of the front
benches may be regarded as the root of all evil in Parliamentary
nature&mdash;the desire to eat of the fruit of the tree of
knowledge which is as fatal to nature born without original
political sin as that disastrous episode in the annals of our
first parents.</p>

<div class="sn">A recollection
of
Disraeli.</div>

<p>One of the most curious episodes in the career of Disraeli
was that he insisted on sitting on the front Opposition
bench before he had ever held office&mdash;an
act of unprecedented and unjustifiable daring
which throws a significant light on that habit of self-assertion
to which he owed a good deal of his success in life. For
what a seat on the front Opposition bench means is, that the
holder thereof has once held office in an administration, and
so is justified for the remainder of his days in regarding himself
as above the common herd. But Jimmy isn't as ordinary
men. A place on the front Opposition bench, with all its
advantages, has the countervailing disadvantages of binding
to a certain decency and decorum of behaviour, and nothing
could be more galling to the free and full soul of the distinguished
steward of the Jockey Club. It is said that in the
same way his colleagues on the front Opposition bench would
prefer Jimmy's room to his company. In Parliamentary
politics, as in diplomacy, there is such a thing as having an
agent whom you can profit by, and at the same time disavow&mdash;just
as it may suit you. That is one of the many guileful
methods of these crafty men who sit on front benches on both
sides of the House. Obstruction is a thing too horrible to be
practised by any man who has ever held responsible position,
and it is delightful to see how Mr. Balfour repudiates the very
idea of anything of the kind. It would, therefore, have
suited Mr. Balfour a good deal better if Jimmy could have
obstructed from some quarter of the House where his closeness
of association would not so largely commit his more
respon<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" class="pagenum" title="Page 70"></a>sible
colleagues to participation in his iniquities. However,
it was not to be managed; and the leaders of the Opposition
are bound to put up with the closeness of Jimmy's companionship.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Lowther's
intellect.</div>

<p>Again I repeat, obstruction is a matter not of intellect,
but temperament. Intellectually, I should put
Jimmy in a very low place, even in the ranks of
the stupid party. Temperamentally he stands
very high. A brief description of his methods of obstruction
will bring this home. First, it should be said that he is
entirely inarticulate and, beyond rough common sense, destitute
of ideas. He has nothing to say, and he cannot say it.
There are men in the House of Commons who have plenty of
thoughts, and who have plenty of words besides, and could
branch out on any subject whatever into a dissertation which
would command the interest even of political foes. But
Jimmy is not of this class. He is capable, on the contrary,
of bringing down the loftiest subject that ever moved human
breasts to something stumbling, commonplace and prosaic.
When he gets up, then, his speech consists rather of a series
of gulps than of articulate or intelligible statements. But
then mark the singular courage and audacity of the whole
proceeding. There are traditions still in the House of
Commons of the marvellously stimulating effect upon followers
of leaders, who were proverbial for their oratorical
impotence. Everybody remembers the scornful description
of Castlereagh which Byron gave to the world; and yet it has
been said in some memoirs that the moment Castlereagh
stood up and adjusted his waistcoat, there was a thrill in the
House of Commons, and his followers bellowed their exultation
and delight. In a more recent day, Lord Althorpe was
able to bear down the hostility of some of the most powerful
orators of his time by a bluff manliness which no rhetoric
could withstand. And so also with Jimmy&mdash;his sheer
audacity carries him along the slow, dull, inept, muddy tide
of his inarticulate speech.</p>

<div><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" class="pagenum" title="Page 71"></a></div>
<div class="sn">An irrepressible
nuisance.</div>

<p>And curiously enough, it is impossible to put him down.
On March 6th he was commenting on some item
which he supposed was in a Post-office Estimate.
It was pointed out to him that the item to which
he alluded was not in that particular vote at all, but in quite
another vote, which came later on. Jimmy, nevertheless,
went on to discuss the item as if nothing had been said.
Then the long-suffering Chairman had to be called in, and he
ruled&mdash;as every human being would have been bound to rule&mdash;that
Jimmy was out of order. Was Jimmy put down?
Not the least in the world. He made an apology, and, as the
apology was ample and his deliverance is slow, the apology
enabled him to consume some more minutes of precious
Government time. And then, having failed to find fault with
the estimate for what it did not contain, he proceeded to
assail it for what it did contain. Here again he was out of
order, for the estimate was prepared exactly as every other
estimate had been prepared for years. This answer was
given to him. But Jimmy went on&mdash;gulping and obstructing,
obstructing and gulping. It is amusing, perhaps, to you who
can read this description as part of an after-dinner's amusement,
but what is one to think of a Parliamentary institution
that can be so flouted, and nullified by mere beef-headed
dulness? This is a question to make any one pause who has
faith in Parliamentary institutions.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Balfour
keeps away.</div>

<p>During all these performances, Mr. Balfour keeps steadily
away from the House. He never was a good
attendant, even in his best of days, and now that
he is relieved of responsibility, he naturally seeks
to take advantage of it. But he doesn't take so much advantage
as one would expect. He who used to be so indolent,
has developed a feverish activity. He seems during some
portions of every sitting to be ready to rise to his feet at the
smallest provocation, and to interfere in the smallest matter
of detail. It is this tendency which has hurried him into
some of those ridiculous errors, which he has made so
fre<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" class="pagenum" title="Page 72"></a>quently.
The explanation of it all, is that curious figure that
sits so silent, remote, and friendless on the front Opposition
bench. Lord Randolph is still the riddle which nobody can
read. Whenever Mr. Balfour appears Lord Randolph does
his best to efface himself, even in the places which men select
on the front bench. Here is a hint of that eternal conflict
and play of ferocious appetites and passions which is going on
in the House of Commons. Everybody who has ever visited
the House of Commons must have observed that pair of
boxes which stand on the table in front of the Speaker's
chair. These boxes mark to the outward world the positions of
the most important men in the House of Commons&mdash;the
Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition. Mr.
Balfour, whenever he is in the House, sits opposite his box,
and so proclaims to all the world the lofty post he holds.
And when this is the case, it is in almost the very last seat&mdash;separated
by half a dozen other individuals&mdash;Lord Randolph
is to be seen. To turn to another part of the House, it is the
men in whom Mr. Gladstone most confides who sit on either
side of him&mdash;Sir William Harcourt and Mr. John Morley.
If on any day it were seen that either of these two men had
left the side of their leader, and was separated from him by
several others, the rumour would run like wildfire through
the House of Commons that the relations of the Premier and
one of his chief lieutenants were strained.</p>

<div class="sn">Deadly foes.</div>

<p>So Mr. Balfour watches Lord Randolph and Lord
Randolph watches Mr. Balfour, with the deadly
vigilance of two men who stand opposite each
other in a wood with drawn swords in their hands. There
is another gentleman, besides, whom the Tory leader has
to watch, and, perhaps, more keenly. Lord Randolph
Churchill is not always in his place, and his movements
in these days are leisurely&mdash;I remember when they were
electric in their rapidity and frequency. But Mr. Chamberlain
is a distinctly ready man. Whatever gifts he has,
are always at his command. He is like the shopman who
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" class="pagenum" title="Page 73"></a>
puts all his goods in the window. The goods are not very
fine nor very good, but they are showy and cheap, and,
above all things, take the eye. Mr. Chamberlain in his day
has been a poor attendant in Parliament&mdash;a friend of his
used to tell him, when he was supposed to have the reversion
of the Liberal leadership, that his inability to remain for
hours in succession in the House of Commons would always
stand in the way of his being the leader of that assembly.
But he turns up now usually after dinner, and from his seat
on the third bench below the gangway, on the Liberal side,
watches the progress of battle. It is known to the intimates
of Mr. Balfour that he has not a particularly high opinion of
his partner in the work of obstructing the cause of Home
Rule. Indeed, it is impossible that the two men should be
really sympathetic with each other. With all his faults, Mr.
Balfour does represent the literary and cultured side of
political life; while Mr. Chamberlain is illiteracy embodied.
Then, Mr. Chamberlain has a knack of attributing every
victory to himself&mdash;modesty isn't one of his many virtues&mdash;and
this cannot be particularly agreeable to the real leader
of the Opposition. There is thus a constant competition
between the two men as to which shall give the marching
orders to the enemies of the Government.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Chamberlain's
slatternly
inaccuracy.</div>

<p>There was a singular scene on March 6th, which brought
out the relations of the two in a singular manner.
There appeared that day in the congenial columns
of the <i>Times</i> a letter, a column in length, and set
forth with all the resources of leaded and displayed
type which the office could afford. In this letter Joe
had lamented the disappearance of those courteous manners
of an elder and more Chesterfieldian time, to which he
suggested he belonged. The origin of this delicious lament
over a venerable and more courteous past by so flagrant a
type of modernity, was a statement that Sir William Harcourt
had played the dirty trick of putting down a notice to
suspend the twelve o'clock rule at a shorter notice than
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" class="pagenum" title="Page 74"></a>
usual. The suspension of the twelve o'clock rule simply
means that the Tories shall not be allowed to obstruct by the
mere fact that the House is compelled automatically to close
at midnight under the existing rules. Joe appeared in his
place swelling with visibly virtuous indignation; evidently
he had come, ready to bear down on Sir William and the
Government generally with the cyclone of attack. But this
notable design was prevented by two accidents. First, Sir
William Harcourt got up and explained that the notice he
had given was exactly the same kind of notice that was
always, and had been always, given in like circumstances.
Everybody who knows anything about Parliamentary matters
knows that this was the literal truth. The dirty trick which
Mr. Chamberlain had attributed to Sir William Harcourt
existed only in his own uninstructed and treacherous memory;
and so he was crushed. Still he wanted to have a word in,
and more than once he showed signs of rising to his feet.
But he stopped half-way, and, when he did finally get up,
Mr. Balfour was before him, and he had to sit down again.
Then his opportunity was lost, for Mr. Balfour had declared
that he was perfectly satisfied with what Sir William Harcourt
had done, and that prevented Joe from entering on the
filibustering tactics which apparently he contemplated. This
appeared to the whole House to be a very distinct and unpleasant
snub for Joseph. A short time afterwards he and
Mr. Balfour were seen in the lobby, engaged in a conversation
that was apparently vehement, and everybody jumped to the
conclusion that they were having it out, and that Joseph was
resenting the rejection of his advice with that haughtiness of
temper which is so well-known a characteristic of the Radical
whom wealth has converted into a leader of the aristocracy.
The papers afterwards contained an announcement that the
two conspirators against Mr. Gladstone's Government were
in the heartiest accord. This was one of the semi-official
denials which are generally regarded as the best testimony to
the truth of the report denied.</p>

<div><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" class="pagenum" title="Page 75"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Mr. Morley.</div>

<p>If one were on the look-out for dramatic and instructive
contrast in the House of Commons, one could
not do better than study Mr. Morley and Mr.
Chamberlain for a week. Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;glib, shallow,
self-possessed, well-trained by years of public life&mdash;debates
admirably. Nobody can deny that&mdash;not even those who, like
myself, find his speaking exasperatingly empty and superficial
and foolish. He is master of all his resources; scarcely
ever pauses for a word, and when he is interrupted, can
parry the stroke with a return blow of lightning-like rapidity.
But when he sits down, is there any human being that feels
a bit the wiser or the better for what he has said? And who
can get over the idea that it has all been a bit of clever
special pleading&mdash;such as one could hear in half-a-dozen
courts of law any day of the week? And, finally, who is
there that can help feeling throughout all the speech that this
is a selfish nature&mdash;full of venom, ambition, and passion&mdash;seeing
in political conflict not great principles to advance&mdash;holy
causes to defend&mdash;happiness to extend&mdash;but so many
enemies' faces to grind to dust?</p>

<p>Mr. Morley is a fine platform speaker, but as yet he is not
nearly as good a debater as Mr. Chamberlain. He stumbles,
hesitates, finds it hard often to get the exact word he wants.
And yet who cannot listen to him for ten minutes without a
sense of a great mind&mdash;and what to me is better, a fine
character behind it all? This man has thought out&mdash;possibly
in travail of spirit&mdash;and his creed&mdash;though it may
not be the exultant cheerfulness of natures richer in muscle
than in thought&mdash;is one for which he will fight and sacrifice,
and not yield. In short, the thinness of Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;the
depths of Mr. Morley&mdash;these are the things which one
will learn from hearing them speak even once.</p>

<p>I have said that Mr. Morley is not as good a debater as
Mr. Chamberlain; but if Mr. Chamberlain be wise, he will
call his watch-dogs off Mr. Morley, for he is being badgered
into an excellent debater. Every night he improves in his
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" class="pagenum" title="Page 76"></a>
answers to questions. Tersely, frigidly&mdash;though there is the
undercurrent of scorn and sacred passion in most of what he
says&mdash;Mr. Morley meets the taunts and charges of the
Russells, and the Macartneys, and the Carsons, and never
yet has he been beaten in one of those hand-to-hand fights.</p>

<div class="sn">Flagrant
obstruction.</div>

<p>There was a curious but instructive little scene towards
the end of a sitting early in March. The Tories&mdash;headed
by Jimmy Lowther&mdash;had been obstructing
in the most shameless way for a whole afternoon.
Towards the end of the evening Mr. Chamberlain had come
down and joined in the fray&mdash;lending his authority to tactics
which usually had been left to the rag-tag and bobtail of all
parties. As I have already said, this kind of intervention had
seriously diminished Mr. Chamberlain in the respect of the
House. And the way in which he did his work was venomous
as well as petty. The vote under discussion was a Supplemental
Estimate for Light Railways in Ireland. Everybody
knows that light railways were the policy of the late and
not of the present Government. A supplemental estimate
means simply a smaller sum by which the original estimate
has been exceeded. It ought to have been a matter of course
that this supplementary estimate should have been agreed
to by the Tories, seeing that it was money necessary to carry
out the programme passed by their own friends in the previous
administration. But the Tories were in no humour to listen
to such trifles as these, and carried on lengthy discussions.
Mr. Morley, having no responsibility for the policy which rendered
such a vote necessary, was away in his room, attending to
the duties of his laborious department. Mr. T.W. Russell assumed
to be in a great pucker over this absence, and actually
tried to stop the proceedings until Mr. Morley came back.</p>

<div class="sn">While a
wronged
nation waits.</div>

<p>Mr. Morley did appear in due course, and then there was
an attempt to assail him for his absence. There
was also an attempt to take advantage of his
presence to resume the discussion of the very
topics which had already been discussed for many hours in his
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" class="pagenum" title="Page 77"></a>
absence. Mr. Morley refused to fall into the trap. Speaking
quietly, but with a deadly blow between every word, he
declined to be a party to obstruction by answering again
questions which had already been answered many times over.
At this, there was a loud shout of approval from the Liberal
benches&mdash;exasperated almost beyond endurance by the shameless
waste of time in which the Tories, aided by Mr. Chamberlain,
had indulged in for so many hours. Mr. Chamberlain
professed to be greatly shocked. But the House was not in a
mood to stand any more nonsense. Mr. Chamberlain and
Mr. Lowther, and the rest of the obstructive gang, had to
submit to have the vote taken. In the meantime there stood
the business of the country to be done. All its needs, its
pressing grievances, its vast chorus of sighs and wails from
wasted lives&mdash;rose up and called for justice; but tricksters,
and self-seekers, and horse-jockeys stopped the way.</p>

<div class="sn">Carlton Club
echoes.</div>

<p>There were signs of the meeting at the Carlton when the
House met on Thursday evening, March 9th.
The Tory benches were crowded; the young bloods
were fuller than ever of that self-consciousness to
which I have adverted, and there were signs of movement,
excitement, and the spirit of mischief and evil in all their
faces and in their general demeanour. There were nearly one
hundred questions on the paper&mdash;and questions had become a
most effective weapon of Obstruction. But there was a certain
peculiarity about the questioning on this Thursday evening.
A stranger to the House would have remarked that all
the questions addressed to Mr. Gladstone were asked last.
This was not an accidental arrangement. It was done in the
case of every leader of the House, so as to leave him more
time before coming down to the House of Commons. It was
done in the case of Mr. Balfour when he was leader of the
House, with the result that that very limp and leisurely
gentleman never came down to his place until the House had
been one or two hours at work. There was, of course, much
stronger reason for that little bit of consideration in the case
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" class="pagenum" title="Page 78"></a>
of Mr. Gladstone, than in that of a young man like
Mr. Balfour.</p>

<div class="sn">The epoch of
brutality.</div>

<p>But the Tories, in the new and brutal mood to which they
have worked themselves up, have taken means for
depriving Mr. Gladstone of what small benefit he
got from this postponement of the questions to
him till the end of question time. The puniest whipster of
the Tory or the Unionist party now is satisfied with nothing
less, if you please, than to have his questions addressed to and
answered by Mr. Gladstone himself. One of this impudent
tribe is a Scotch Unionist named Cochrane. The Scotch
Unionist is one of the most bitter of the venomous tribe to
which he belongs. Mr. Gladstone is a man of peace and
unfailing courtesy, but the old lion has potentialities of
Olympian wrath, and when he is stirred up a little too much
his patience gives way, and he has a manner of shaking his
mane and sweeping round with his tail which is dangerous to
his enemies and a delight and fascination to his friends. He
took up the witless and unhappy Cochrane, shook him, and
dropped him sprawling and mutilated, in about as limp a condition
as the late Lord Wolmer&mdash;I call him late in the sense
of a person politically dead&mdash;when that distinguished nobleman
was called to account for his odious calumny on the
Irish members.</p>

<div class="sn">Baiting the
lion.</div>

<p>At last, however, the Cochranes and the rest of the gang
that had thought it fine fun to bait an old man
were silenced; but even yet the ordeal of
Mr. Gladstone was only beginning. I have seen
many disgusting sights in my time in the House of
Commons; but I never saw anything so bad as this scene.
Mr. Gladstone looked&mdash;as I thought&mdash;wan and rather tired.
He had been down to Brighton; and I have a profound
disbelief in these short hurried trips to the seaside. But
Mr. Gladstone seems to like them, and haply they do him
good. He looked as if the last trip had rather tired him out.
Or was it that he had had to sit for several hours the day
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" class="pagenum" title="Page 79"></a>
before at a Cabinet Council? These Cabinet Councils must
often be a great trial to a leader's nerves; for all Councils in
every body in the world mean division of opinion, personal
frictions, ugly outbursts of temper, from which even the
celestial minds of political leaders are not entirely free.
Anyhow Mr. Gladstone looked pale, fagged, and even a little
dejected. You&mdash;simple man&mdash;who are only acquainted with
human nature in its brighter and better manifestations, would
rush to the conclusion that the sight of the greatest man of his
time in his eighty-fourth year, thus wan, wearied, pathetic,
would appeal to the imaginations or the hearts of even
political opponents. Simple man, you know nothing of the
ruthless cruelty which dwells in political breasts, of the
savagery which lies in the depths of the horse-jockey squire
or the overdressed youth&mdash;anxious to distinguish himself, if
it be only by throwing mud at a stately column&mdash;you have no
idea of these things.</p>

<div class="sn">The lion
lashes out.</div>

<p>Time after time&mdash;again and again&mdash;in this form and in
that&mdash;the Tories, young and old, experienced and
senseless, rose to try and corner Mr. Gladstone.
Mr. Frank Lockwood, examining a hostile witness
in the divorce court, could not have been more persistent than
the Lowthers, and the Cranbornes, and even Mr. Balfour.
But he was equal to them all&mdash;met them man after man,
question after question, and, though he had to be on his feet
a score of times in the course of a few minutes, was always
ready, firm, alert. How we enjoyed the whole splendid
display&mdash;a brilliant intellect playing with all the ease of its
brightest and best powers; but, after all, what a flood of holy
rage the whole thing was calculated to rouse in any but
rancorous breasts. However, we had our revenge. The
resurgence of Jimmy Lowther seems to be a phenomenon,
as disturbing to his friends as to his foes. The ugly necessity
for sharing responsibility for his vulgar and senseless excesses
has come home to Mr. Balfour. There was something very like
a scene this night between him and the Newmarket steward.
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" class="pagenum" title="Page 80"></a>
Mr. Balfour was ready to accept the assurances which had
been given to him by Mr. Gladstone&mdash;assurances which, if
anything, erred on the side of conciliation&mdash;but Jimmy has
entered on the frenzied campaign of obstruction to all and
everything which his dull, narrow, and obstinate mind has
mistaken for high policy. This led to a strange and striking
scene. Mr. Balfour, speaking on some question, was interrupted
by Mr. Lowther&mdash;and then, in front of the whole
House&mdash;in words which everybody could hear, with gesture
of his whole arm&mdash;sweeping, indignant, irritated&mdash;the
gesture with which a master dismisses an importunate
servant&mdash;the Tory leader rebuked the interruptions of Mr.
Lowther.</p>

<div class="sn">Jimmy flouts
Mr. Balfour.</div>

<p>But Mr. Lowther, in these days, is not to be put down,
and doubtless he feels in his inner breast that
wrong which has been done for years to his
talents and his services; doubtless he remembers
the silence and obscurity to which he has been condemned,
while Mr. Balfour has been figuring largely before the general
public, in the very situation which Jimmy held himself in days
when Mr. Balfour stumbled and trembled from his place below
the gangway. At all events, Jimmy has determined to revive;
and in these sad days, when nothing but the sheer brutality
of obstruction is required, he is not a man to be trifled with.
And so he defied Mr. Balfour and insisted on a division. Mr.
Balfour ostentatiously left the House, but the majority of the
Tory party followed Jimmy.</p>

<div class="sn">The pity
of it.</div>

<p>All this resuscitation of obstruction necessitated, on Mr.
Gladstone's part, an extreme step. Before this
time Mr. Gladstone was very rarely in the House
after eight o'clock. About that hour, he silently
stole away and left the conduct of the business of the House
to Sir William Harcourt. He was thus able to get to bed at
a reasonable hour, and to attend during the day to the
business of the nation. But when the emergency arises, Mr.
Gladstone is never able to listen to the dictates of prudence,
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" class="pagenum" title="Page 81"></a>
or selfishness, or peril. He was determined to show the
Tories that if they were going to play the game of obstruction,
they would have to count with him more seriously than they
imagine. To his friends&mdash;who doubtless were aghast at the
proposition&mdash;he announced that he was going to break
through those rules which had been imposed upon him by
a watchful physician and by his age. At eleven o'clock he
announced he would be in the House again, and accordingly,
at eleven o'clock&mdash;quietly, unostentatiously, without the
welcome of a cheer&mdash;he almost stole to his place on the
Treasury Bench. Something about the figure of Mr.
Gladstone compels the concentration of attention upon him
at all times. He seems the soul, the inspiration, the genius
of the House of Commons. He was not, as is usually the
case with him in the evening, in the swallow-tail and large
shirt-front of evening dress; he had the long, black, frock
coat, which he usually wears on the great occasions when he
has a mighty speech to deliver. Of course, Mr. Gladstone
was immediately the observed of every eye; but, as I have
said, there was no demonstration&mdash;the House of Commons
is often silent at its most sublime moments.</p>

<div class="sn">He pounces.</div>

<p>But if there were silence, it was simply pent-up rage, fierce
resolve. When, having brought the discussion
down to past midnight, the Tories calmly proposed
that the debate should be adjourned, the Old Man got up.
He was very quiet, spoke almost in whispered lowliness; but
he was unmistakable. The vote would have to be taken. An
hour later&mdash;when the clock pointed to one&mdash;there was a
second attempt. There was the same response in the same
tone&mdash;its quietness, however, fiercely accentuated by Liberal
cheers. And then, when the Tories still seemed determined to
obstruct, came a division, then the closure, and at one o'clock
in the morning Mr. Gladstone was able to leave the House.
Thus was he compelled to waste time and strength, that Mr.
Chamberlain might nightly hiss his hate, and Mr. Jimmy
Lowther might gulp and obstruct, obstruct and gulp.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI" />CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>GLADSTONE THE SURVIVAL.</h3>


<div class="sn">From the
past.</div>

<p>What I like most about Mr. Gladstone is his antique
spirituality. The modern politician is smart,
alive, pert, up-to-date; knows everything about
registration; hires a good agent; can run a
caucus, and receive a deputation. With us, as yet, the
modern politician has not wholly abandoned religious faith&mdash;as
he has done among our neighbours on the Continent&mdash;and
has not come to regard this solid earth of ours as the one
standing-place in a universe alone worthy the consideration
of intelligent men. But the English politician is so far
suffused with the spirit of modernity as to prefer the newspaper
to the book, to regard more closely registration records
than the classics, and generally is wide awake rather than
steeped in subtler and profounder forms of sagacity and
knowledge. The Prime Minister is a Survival. With all his
extraordinary adaptiveness, he stands in many respects in
sharpest contrast to his environment. I can never forget, as
I look at him, all those years he spent in that vanished epoch
which knew nothing of evolution or of science at all, and
was content to regard a knowledge of the classics as the
beginning and the end of a gentleman's education. After
reading the life of Lord Aberdeen, I was brought back in
spirit to all those years during which Mr. Gladstone was a
member of the Tory party, and lived in an atmosphere of
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" class="pagenum" title="Page 83"></a>
proud, scholarly exclusiveness&mdash;of distrust of the multitude&mdash;of
ecclesiasticism in the home, in the forum, and as the
foundation of all political controversy. When, therefore,
Mr. Gladstone is going through a crisis, it is intensely interesting
to me to watch him and to see how he carries
himself amid it all; and then it is that this thought occurs
to me of how differently and clearly he stands out from all
his colleagues and surroundings.</p>

<div class="sn">A reminiscence.</div>

<p>Different things suggest early associations to different
people. Mrs. Solness, in the &quot;Master Builder,&quot;
could think only of her dolls when she was telling
the story of the fire that left her childless for
ever. I have heard of a great lady who cannot see a shell
without recalling the scenes of her dead youth before her.
Next to the railway bridge which spans the river in my
native town, there is nothing which brings back the past to
me so palpably and so vividly&mdash;I might sometimes say, so
poignantly&mdash;as the echoes of books. One of my clearest
recollections is of a little room, looking out on a sunny and,
as it appeared to me then, a beautifully-kept garden, with a
small but glistening river in the distance, and the air filled,
not only with the songs of birds, but all the intoxicating and
inaudible music of youth's dreams and visions. All this
phantasmagoria of memory is accompanied by the echo of a
melodious, rich voice, rising and falling, in the to me unfamiliar
but delightful accent of an educated Englishman:
and the story of Ancient Greece&mdash;sometimes her poetry with
the loves of her gods, the fights, the shouts of battle, the
exhortations and the groans of her heroes&mdash;rises once more
before me. Or, again, I hear the tale told anew of that
great last immortal day in the life of Socrates, as the great
Philosopher sank to rest in a glory of self-sacrificing submission,
serenity, and courage&mdash;a story which moves the
world to tears and admiration, and will continue so to do
as long as it endures. The voice of the teacher and the
friend still survives, which had this extraordinary power of
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" class="pagenum" title="Page 84"></a>
giving in the very different tongue of England all the glories
of the poetry and the prose of Greece; and other youths,
doubtless like me, look out under the spell of its music to
that same green garden in far-off Galway, by the side of
Corrib's stream.</p>

<div class="sn">Gladstone
dreams.</div>

<p>Of all this I sate musing during some idle moments in
the middle of March; for, as I looked at Mr.
Gladstone, the whole scene was, by a curious
trick of memory and association, brought back to
me. Everyone who knew the great old Philosopher of
Athens, will remember that he had his familiar <i>d&aelig;mon</i>, and
that he believed himself to have constant communication
with him. If I remember rightly, there is a good deal about
that <i>d&aelig;mon</i> in his &quot;Ph&aelig;do&quot;&mdash;that wonderful story to which
I have just alluded, and which lives so vividly in my memory.
Sometimes I think that Mr. Gladstone has the same superstition.
He has moments&mdash;especially if there be the stress
of the sheer brutality of obstructive and knavish hostility&mdash;when
he seems to retire into himself&mdash;to transfer himself on
the wings of imagination to regions infinitely beyond the
reach, as well as the ken, of the land in which the Lowthers,
the Chamberlains, and the Bartleys dwell. At such moments
he gives one the impression of communing with some spirit
within his own breast&mdash;a familiar <i>d&aelig;mon</i>, whose voice, though
still and silent to all outside, shouts louder than the roar of
faction or the shouts of brutish hate. Then it is that I
remember what depths of religious fervour there are in this
leader of a fierce democracy, and can imagine that ofttimes
his communings may, perchance, be silent prayer.</p>

<div class="sn">In contrast
with
Lowther.</div>

<p>As I have said, there have been many such moments in
those days in Parliament. Mr. Gladstone can be
severe&mdash;wrathful&mdash;even cruel. It is not often
that he is so, but sometimes he has, in sheer
self-defence, to notice the dogs that yelp at his heels, and to
lash out and maul them so as to keep off the rest. Nobody
will forget how, in a few words, Mr. Gladstone mercilessly
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" class="pagenum" title="Page 85"></a>
and for ever crushed that impudent young gentleman, who is
titled and considered to-day largely because Mr. Gladstone
was the patron of his sanctimonious father. Mr. Jesse
Collings hides under a painfully extorted smile the agonies he
endures on the few occasions when Mr. Gladstone deems it
worth his while to scornfully refer to his apostasy. But,
speaking generally, Mr. Gladstone uses his giant powers with
extraordinary benignity and mercifulness, and is almost
tender with even his bitterest opponents. When, therefore,
Mr. Gladstone was being baited by beef-headed Lowther, he
for the most part looked simply pained; and took refuge in
that far-off self-absorption which enabled him to forget the
odious reality in front of him. And assuredly, if you looked
at the face of Gladstone, and then at the face of Lowther,
and thought of the different purposes of the two men, you
could not be surprised that Mr. Gladstone should desire to
forget the existence of Mr. Lowther. Mr. Lowther's face,
with its high cheek-bones, its heavy underhung lip, like the
national bulldog in size, and in its impression of brutal, dull,
heavy tenacity&mdash;its grotesque good-humour&mdash;its unrelieved
coarseness&mdash;brings out into higher contrast and bolder
relief the waxen pallor, the beautifully chiselled features, the
dominant benignity and refinement of the face of Mr. Gladstone.
And, then, think that the one man is fighting to
maintain, and the other to put an end, and for ever, to the
hateful, bloody, and, it might almost be said, bestial struggle
of centuries; and you can understand the feeling of overwhelming
loathing which sometimes rises in the breasts of
those who see the two men pitted against each other.</p>

<div class="sn">For Jimmy
was leader.</div>

<p>For this was what it had come to in the House of Commons.
It was Jimmy Lowther against Mr.
Gladstone. Mr. Balfour occasionally dropped in
a perfunctory word; now and then even tried to
raise the standard of revolt against Mr. Lowther; and, of
course, had finally to accept the consequences of Mr.
Lowther's acts. Joe was there too; much more active in
<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" class="pagenum" title="Page 86"></a>
sympathy with Jimmy than Mr. Balfour. With all his faults,
there is a certain saving refinement in Mr. Balfour&mdash;it is not a
refinement that has restrained him from being cruel with the
hysteric violence of the effeminate, but it is a refinement that
preserves him from the mere Newmarket horseplay of Jimmy
Lowther, and the thin rancour of a Brummagem drummer.
Joe, I say, was there, ready to back up Jimmy in his worst
exploits, but, after all, Jimmy was the leader. In this mighty
struggle&mdash;not merely for the reconciliation of England and
Ireland, but for the existence of Parliamentary institutions&mdash;the
stakes are no smaller&mdash;the gentlemen of England were
represented by Mr. Lowther, and the rude democracy by Mr.
Gladstone. Democrats need not feel much ashamed of the
contrast.</p>

<div class="sn">The apotheosis
of
Jimmy.</div>

<p>But there Jimmy Lowther was, gulping and obstructing,
obstructing and gulping. The deadly and almost
animal dulness of the performance I must insist
on again and again. Mr. Lowther does not speak&mdash;he
is as inarticulate as one of the prize bulls which, I doubt
not, he delights to view at Islington what time the Agricultural
Hall opens its portals to fat men and fat beasts. He cannot
stand on his legs for five minutes together without saying
half-a-dozen times, &quot;I repeat what I have already said;&quot; he
has no ideas, no language, nothing except sheer bull-headed
power of standing on his legs, and occupying a certain amount
of time. Everybody knows that Lowtherism reached its
climax on Saturday, March 11th. On that day, men, who
had held high office, were not ashamed to resort to so mean
and palpable an obstructive expedient as to put on paper
twenty-two questions to their successors in office. The
previous Friday had been bad enough. That was the day
which tried Mr. Gladstone more, perhaps, than any day for
many a year; and, indeed, it tried others as much as he,
though not everybody bore it with the same iron and inflexible
courage. There were large absences&mdash;some of the Irish away
at conventions in Ireland, others without that legitimate
ex<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" class="pagenum" title="Page 87"></a>cuse;
there were Liberal absentees as well. Obstruction,
meantime, stalked triumphantly; and when the divisions
came, our strength sank down to almost invisible figures.
Ah! it was saddening to look at Mr. Gladstone's face
throughout that long morning sitting of Friday, March 10th.
There are some days that live in one's memory, not so much
as days as nights&mdash;with the ghastly spectres of darkness&mdash;nightmares&mdash;hauntings
of a hideous past&mdash;anticipations of a
joyless future. Such that Friday remains in my memory&mdash;with
Mr. Gladstone's face standing out from the surrounding
figures&mdash;pale, remote, pained.</p>

<div class="sn">The G.O.M. as
a lecturer.</div>

<p>The announcement of the following Monday came only as
a surprise to those who had not been fully behind
the scenes. There were few, who knew the impression
that the Friday had made, who did not
feel sure that the game of pushing the Home Rule Bill on
before Easy Easter was up, and that Mr. Gladstone had been
beaten by the sheer brutality of Obstruction. But still hope
springs eternal in the Irish breast, and there was still the
lingering feeling that Mr. Gladstone would make a further
and more desperate effort to break down one of the most
shameless crusades of Obstruction on which a great party had
ever entered. Indeed, Mr. Gladstone himself was responsible
for a rise in the temperature of his own party on the very
evening of that fateful and fatal Friday morning, when
obstruction and the abandonment of their own friends had so
nearly driven the Government out of office. I could scarcely
believe my eyes when at nine o'clock on that day I came down
to the almost empty House&mdash;in these evening sittings the
House always looks about as cheerful as a theatre at mid-day&mdash;and
saw Mr. Gladstone on the Treasury Bench, almost
radiant, and evidently full of speech, go, and spirit. There
wasn't really the smallest necessity for his presence. Nothing
stood on the paper save one of those harmless, futile motions
which are discussed with about as much interest by the House
generally, as &quot;abstract love&quot;&mdash;to use a bold figure of Labby
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" class="pagenum" title="Page 88"></a>
in a recent debate. It was a motion which complained that
private members did not get sufficient time. Considering
that private members had used their privileges for some two
weeks previously to destroy the very foundation of all representative
Government&mdash;namely, that the majority shall
prevail&mdash;the complaint seemed a little audacious. Anyhow,
a debate upon it could lead nowhere. But the moment the
resolution was proposed, up stood the Grand Old Man, and
delivered a bright, sparkling little academical address, for all
the world like the lecture of a very <i>spirituel</i> French professor
to a parcel of boys from the Quartier Latin. For the moment
you could actually imagine that the Old Man had forgotten
that there were such things in the world as Home Rule,
Obstruction, Newmarket Lowther, and
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;Brummagen&quot; in the original text">Brummagem</ins>
Joe. And
all the time here were we, who could be his sons, grinding
our hearts in despair&mdash;in futile anger&mdash;in melancholy
retrospect.</p>

<div class="sn">An hour of
gloom.</div>

<p>With the Monday, however, came a biting frost. The
news that Mr. Gladstone had been struck down
from the fray, was sufficient to prepare anybody
for the final announcement. With him leading
the Liberal hosts, one could feel that obstruction could finally
be beaten, however obstinate might be its resistance&mdash;for he
has the faith that moves mountains. Then came the announcement
that the second reading of the Home Rule Bill
had been postponed till after Easter. The Tories and the
Unionists were apparently taken by surprise; so much so that
they did not seem to have the power of yelling forth their
delight at the triumph of their policy with that full chorus
which one would have expected. Altogether, the announcement
came upon the House, and passed the House, with a
quickness and a greater quietness than one might have expected.
The consequences were too serious to be grasped
immediately; and men were almost anxious to get to the
lobbies for the purpose of discussing it in all its bearings.</p>

<p>The rest of the week was but a poor falling-off after the
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" class="pagenum" title="Page 89"></a>
heroic and tragic fever of its opening, and of the week which
preceded it. One could see that in the Liberal ranks there
had succeeded to the fierce fighting spirit of the previous days
a certain lassitude and disappointment. What their faces
told in the House their lips more freely uttered in the lobbies.
For a time, indeed, there was a feeling of almost unreasoning
despair, and that full, frank, unsparing criticism to which
every Government is subject from its friends when the winds
blow and the waves are high. It was said that the Government
had committed the mistake of making too many targets at
once; that they had first infuriated the Church by the Welsh
Suspensory Bill; that they had followed this up by infuriating
the publicans and the brewers by the Veto Bill; that, meantime,
there was very little chance of their being able to obtain
the compensatory advantage of getting these Bills passed into
law. There were grumblings about the Registration Bill; in
short, nothing and nobody were spared in this hour of gloom
and disaster.</p>

<div class="sn">&quot;Herr
Schloss.&quot;</div>

<p>But the House of Commons&mdash;as I have often remarked&mdash;is
like a barometer in the promptitude of its reflection
of every momentary phase, and all these
things are duly discounted by old Parliamentary
hands accustomed to panics when a check comes to what has
been a most successful campaign on the whole. And in the
meantime, if there had been any tendency to disintegration,
it was soon restored by the conduct of the Tories. For, the
old game of obstruction and vituperation went on just as
strongly as if no concession had been made, and no victory
gained. The Monday night had been reserved for a debate
on the Evicted Tenants' Commission. And Mr. T.W.
Russell, brimful of notes and venom, sate in his place, as
impatient to rise as the captive and exuberant balloon which
only strong ropes and the knotted arms of men hold tight to
mother earth. Jimmy, however, has a passion for his
ignoble calling; he sings at his work like the gravedigger in
&quot;Hamlet.&quot; And before the inflated Russell was able to
<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" class="pagenum" title="Page 90"></a>
explode, Jimmy had an hour or so to himself in the discussion
of Mr. Mundella's efforts to deal with labour. It was on
this occasion that Jimmy spread something like dismay in
the bench on which he sate. Mr. Schloss, who had been
appointed as a correspondent by Mr. Mundella, has a name
which shows a German origin. Jimmy insisted on speaking of
him accordingly as &quot;Herr Schloss.&quot; And there, not a yard from
Jimmy, sate the Baron de Worms, one of the most portentous
and pretentious of English patriots, who bears not only a
German name, but a German title. I don't know whether
&quot;Herr&quot; Goschen was in the House at the same time; if so,
his feelings must have been very poignant. Mr. Mundella
doesn't know how to treat these Obstructives. The main
thing is not to take them seriously. Jimmy, to tell the truth,
makes no pretence of taking himself seriously, and grins
through a horse-collar most of the time he is speaking. But
the poor President of the Board of Trade is conscious of doing
everything man can do to help to the solution of the vexed
questions of the time. He cannot avoid allowing himself to
be worked up into a frenzy by imputations which he ought to
know are simply intended for the purpose of getting him out
of temper, and so prolonging debate.</p>

<div class="sn">Sir John
Gorst.</div>

<p>Sir John Gorst is one of the men who have again been
brought much into evidence by the turn events
have taken. I remember the time when he first
made a Parliamentary figure. It was in the days
when Lord Randolph Churchill started out on his great and
meteoric career, at the beginning of the Parliament of '80.
Sir John Gorst was, in many respects, the cleverest of the
brilliant little group&mdash;at least, at the work which they were
then doing. He is cold-blooded, quick, and dexterous, and,
above all things, he has supreme pessimism and cynicism.
To him, all political warfare is a somewhat squalid struggle,
in which everybody is dishonest, and everybody playing for
his own hand. It is an advantage in some respects to take
that view; it saves a man from anything like unduly
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" class="pagenum" title="Page 91"></a>
passionate convictions&mdash;enables him to keep cool even in
trying circumstances. I have seen Sir John as cold as ice
in the very height and ecstasy of the most passionate
moments in the fierce Parliament of 1880 to 1885, and a
man who remains so cool is sure to be able to strike his
blows deliberately and home. My poor friend, Mr. Mundella,
sometimes forgets this. When Sir John Gorst accused him
of slighting somebody&mdash;I don't know who; and, really, it
doesn't matter, for Sir John Gorst knew very well that the
charge was entirely unfounded&mdash;when, I say, Sir John did
this, up jumped honest Mr. Mundella to indignantly deny
that he had ever done anything of the kind. Of course, he
hadn't, and Sir John Gorst knew that as well as Mr.
Mundella. But then, ten minutes were wasted in the
encounter; and even ten minutes are not despised by Jimmy
and his compeers.</p>

<div class="sn">T.W. Russell.</div>

<p>At last, this was got over, and the time came for T.W.
Russell. There are few men in the House of
Commons who excite such violent dislike on
Liberal and Irish Benches as this pre-eminently disagreeable
personality. The dislike is well founded. It is not because
Mr. Russell is rancorous, or has strong opinions; it is
because nobody has any faith in his sincerity. For many
years of his life he was a paid teetotal lecturer. Teetotalism
is a counsel of perfection, and teetotallers are estimable men,
but the paid platform advocate of teetotalism is never a very
attractive personality. This tendency to shout, and thump
the table, and work up the agony&mdash;this eternal pitching of
the voice to the scream that will terrify the groundlings,
appal the sinner, and bring down the house&mdash;all these
things produce a style of oratory which is about as disagreeable
as anything in the shape of oratory can be. Above
all things, it is difficult to take the itinerant lecturer
seriously, with his smoking meal at home as a reward for
his philanthropic efforts. The whole thing produces on the
mind the impression of a clap-trap performance, with no
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" class="pagenum" title="Page 92"></a>
heart or soul underneath all its ravings, bellowings, and
dervish-like contortions.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell has ceased to be a teetotal lecturer, and has
become a stump orator for the Unionist party, but the scent
of the teetotal platform hangs round him still. He yells,
bellows, and twists himself about, puts all his statements
with ridiculous exaggeration&mdash;altogether, so overdoes the
part that it is only the wildest and emptiest Tory who is taken
in by him. What spoils the whole thing to my mind is that
it is all so evidently artificial&mdash;so palpably pumped up.
Clapping his hand on his breast, lifting his shaky fingers
to Heaven, Mr. Russell is always in a frenzied protestation
of honesty, of rugged and unassailable virtue, of bitter
vaticination against the wickedness of the rest of mankind.
No man could be as honest as he professes to be, and live.
The whole thing would be exquisite acting if, underneath all
this conscious exaggeration, you did not see the mere political
bravo. You turn sometimes, and sicken as though you were
at the country fair, and saw the poor raucous-throated
charlatan eating fire or swallowing swords to the hideous
accompaniments of the big drum and the deafening cymbal.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Carson.</div>

<p>No&mdash;Mr. T.W. Russell is the mere play-actor. If you
want one of the real actualities in the more
sinister side of Irish life, look at and study Mr.
Carson. It is he who winds up the debate on the commission
of Mr. Justice Mathew&mdash;a debate made memorable by the
ablest debating speech Mr. Morley has made in the whole
course of his Parliamentary career. I see men talking to
Mr. Carson that belong to an opposite side of politics. I
confess that I never see him pass without an internal
shudder. Just as the sight of an abb&eacute; gave M. Homais, in
&quot;Madame Bovary,&quot; an unpleasant whiff of the winding-sheet,
there is something in the whole appearance of Mr.
Carson that conveys to me the dank smell of the prison, and
the suffocating sense of the scaffold. Do you remember
that strange, terrible day in the &quot;Derni&egrave;re Incarnation de
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" class="pagenum" title="Page 93"></a>
Vautrin,&quot; in which Balzac describes Vautrin's passage
through the ranks of the gaol-birds and gaol officials among
whom he had passed so much of his life? Above all, do
you recall that final, and supreme, and awful touch in which,
addressing consciously the handler of the guillotine, he
professes to take him for the chaplain, and, bringing the poor
executioner for once to confusion, is addressed with blushing
face and trembling lips with the observation, &quot;Non,
Monsieur, j'ai d'autres fonctions&quot;?</p>

<div class="sn">Green Street
Court-House.</div>

<p>Mr. Carson, doubtless, has &quot;autres fonctions&quot; than that
of Jack Ketch&mdash;who has always been so efficient
and constant an instrument of Government in
Ireland&mdash;but I am never able to regard one part
of the official machinery by which wronged nations are held
down as very different from the other. Above all, I am
unable to make much distinction between the final agent in
the gaol and those other actors who play with loaded dice
the bloody game in the criminal court with the partisan judge
and the packed jury. Doubtless, happy reader, you have
never been in a place called Green Street Court-House, in
Dublin. If you ever go to the Irish capital, pay that spot a
visit. It will compensate you&mdash;especially if you can get
some <i>cicerone</i> who will tell you some of the associations that
cling around the spot. It is in a back street&mdash;narrow,
squalid, filthy&mdash;surrounded by all those signs of crumbling
decay which speak more loudly to the visitor to Dublin of
the decay and destruction of a nation than fieriest orator or
solidest history. And in no part of Dublin have Death's
effacing fingers worked with such destructiveness as in all the
streets that surround the Green Street Court-House. Palatial
mansions are windowless, grimy, hideous&mdash;with all the
ghastly surroundings of tenement homes of the very poor.</p>

<p>It is in Green Street Court-House that the political
offenders in Ireland are tried. Within its narrow and grimy
walls I saw many a gallant Irishman, when I was a young
reporter, pass through a foregone and prearranged trial to
<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" class="pagenum" title="Page 94"></a>
torture, agony, madness, premature death. I can only think
of it as of a shambles, or, perhaps, to put it more strongly,
but more accurately, as I think of that wooden framework in
which I saw the murderer, Henry Wainwright, hanged by
the neck one foggy morning years ago, a gallows. The jury
was packed, and the judges on the bench were as much a part
of the machinery of prosecution as the Counsel for the
Crown. The whole thing was a ghastly farce&mdash;as ghastly as
the private enquiries that intervene between the Russian
rebel and the hunger, and solitude, and death of the fortress
of St. Peter and St. Paul, or the march to Siberia.</p>

<div class="sn">The lawyer
and the
hangman.</div>

<p>In all such squalid tragedies, men of the Carson type are
a necessary portion of the machinery, as necessary
as the informer that betrays&mdash;as the warder who
locks the door&mdash;as the hangman who coils the
rope. Mark you, all the forms&mdash;all the precautions&mdash;all the
outward seeming of English law and liberty&mdash;are in these
Irish courts. The outside is just the same as in any
court that meets in the Old Bailey; but it is all the mask
and the drapery, behind which the real figures are the
foregone verdict, the partisan judge&mdash;the prepared cell
or constructed gallows. In the regime of coercion which
has just expired, the whole machinery was in motion. The
last sentence of the law was not resorted to in political
offence, for the days of rebellion in the open field had
passed. But there were the Resident Magistrates ready
to do their master Balfour's bidding, and to send men to
imprisonment, in some cases followed by bread-and-water
discipline&mdash;by stripping of clothes and other atrocities, which
made the court of the Resident Magistrate the antechamber
to the cell, and the cell the antechamber to the tomb. In all
these ghastly and tragic dramas, enacted all over Ireland,
Mr. Carson was the chief figure&mdash;self-confident, braggart,
deliberate&mdash;winding the rope around his victim's neck with
all the assured certainty of the British Empire, Mr. Balfour
and the Resident Magistrates behind him.</p>

<div><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" class="pagenum" title="Page 95"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Mr. Carson's
exterior.</div>

<p>Nature has stamped on Mr. Carson's exterior the full
proclamation of his character and career. There is
something about his appearance and manner that
somehow or other seems to belong rather to the last
than the present century. He is a very up-to-date gentleman
in every sense of the word&mdash;clothes included. But the long,
lantern, black-coloured jaws, the protruding mouth, the
cavernous eyes, the high forehead with the hair combed
straight back&mdash;all seem to suggest that he ought to be
wearing the wig, the queue, and the sword of the eighteenth
century. He looks as though he had come from consultation,
not with Mr. Balfour, but Lord Castlereagh, and as if the
work he were engaged in was the sending of the Brothers
Sheares to Tyburn, not William O'Brien to Tullamore, and
as though he had stopped up o' nights to go over again the
list of the Irishmen that could be bought or bullied, or
cajoled into the betrayal of Ireland's Parliament.</p>

<p>Look at him as he stands at the box. You can see that
he has been bred into almost impudent self-confidence, by
those coercion tribunals, in which the best men of Ireland
lay at the mercy of a creature like Mr. Balfour and the
meaner creatures who were ready to do Mr. Balfour's work.
Mr. Carson, not a year in the House, places his hands on the
box, then on his hips, with all the airs of a man who had
been in Parliament for a lifetime&mdash;attacks Mr. Gladstone,
Mr. Morley, Mr. Justice Mathew&mdash;three of the highest-minded
and ablest men of their time&mdash;as though he were
at Petty Sessions, with Mr. Cecil Roche dispensing justice.
It is an odious sight. It makes even Englishmen shudder. But
it has its uses. It throws on to the floor of the House of
Commons with all the illumination of those great times, the
abysses and passions and sinister figures in Ireland's moving
tragedy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII" />CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A FORTNIGHT OF QUIET WORK.</h3>


<div class="sn">Dulness.</div>

<p>The House did very good work during the last fortnight in
March. This has a corollary more
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;satifactory&quot; in the original text">satisfactory</ins> to
the public than to the journalist; for, whenever
business is progressing, it invariably means that the proceedings
have been extremely dull. It is a well-known
phenomenon of the House of Commons, that the moment
there is a chance of anything like a personal scene&mdash;though
the encounter be of the smallest possible moment and affect
nothing beyond two personalities of no particular importance&mdash;it
is well known that whenever such scene is promised, the
benches of the House of Commons prove too small for the
huge crowds that rush to them from all parts. Mr. Fowler
introduced one of the most revolutionary measures ever
brought into the House of Commons&mdash;revolutionary I mean,
of course, in the good sense&mdash;and yet he delivered his new
gospel of emancipation to a House that at no period was in
the least crowded, and that was never excited. Happy is the
country that has no annals, fruitful is the Parliament that
has no scenes.</p>

<div class="sn">Uganda
again.</div>

<p>But there were signs of something like storm at certain
portions of the sitting on March 20th, for there
stood on the paper the Estimate which raised the
difficult question of Uganda, and on that question,
as everybody knows, there is a yawning gulf between the
opinions of Mr. Labouchere and a number of Radicals below
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" class="pagenum" title="Page 97"></a>
the gangway, and the occupants of the Treasury Bench.
Of Mr. Labouchere the saying may be used, which is often
employed with regard to weak men&mdash;Mr. Labouchere is far
from a weak man&mdash;he is his own worst enemy. His delight
in persiflage, his keen wit&mdash;his love of the pose of the
bloodless and cynical Boulevardier&mdash;have served to conceal
from Parliament, and sometimes, perhaps, even from himself,
the sincerity of his convictions, and the masculine strength
and firmness of his will. Somehow or other, he is least
effective when he is most serious. His speech on Uganda,
for instance, was admirably put together, and chock full of
facts, sound in argument, and in its seriousness quite equal
to the magnitude of the issues which it raised. But no man
is allowed to play &quot;out of his part&quot;&mdash;as the German phrase
goes. Labby has accustomed the House to expect amusement
from him, and it will not be satisfied unless he gives
it. When, therefore, he does make a serious speech, the
House insists on considering it dull, and rarely lends to him
its attentive and serious ear.</p>

<div class="sn">Which is the
buffoon?</div>

<p>Great and yet fatal is the power of oratory. In the course
of this same night's debate, Mr. Chamberlain also
made a speech. During portions of it he delighted
the House, and it was extremely effective as a
party speech. In the course of his observations, Mr. Chamberlain,
alluding to some jokelet of Labby, declared that a
great question like Uganda should not be treated in a spirit
of &quot;buffoonery.&quot; That observation was rude, and scarcely
Parliamentary. But that is not the point&mdash;nobody expects
gentlemanly feeling or speech from Mr. Chamberlain. The
point is that the observation could have been applied with
much more truth to the speech of Mr. Chamberlain than to
that of Labby; for Mr. Chamberlain's speech consisted, for
the most part, of nothing better than the merest party hits&mdash;the
kind of thing that almost anybody could say&mdash;that
hundreds of journalists nightly write in their party effusions,
and for very modest salaries. But the heart and soul of the
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" class="pagenum" title="Page 98"></a>
question of Uganda were not even touched by Mr. Chamberlain.
Labby may have been right or wrong; but Labby's
was a serious speech with a serious purpose. Mr. Chamberlain's
speech was just a smart bit of party debating. The
buffoonery&mdash;in the sense of shallowness and emptiness&mdash;was
really in the speech that everybody took to be grave. The
seriousness was in the speech which, amid the delighted
applause of the Tories, Mr. Chamberlain denounced as
buffoonery.</p>

<div class="sn">The grip
of Labby.</div>

<p>In some respects Mr. Labouchere reminds me of the late
Mr. Biggar. Underneath all his exterior of
carelessness, callousness, and flippancy, there
lies a very strong, a very tenacious, and a very
clear-sighted man. There are times&mdash;especially when the
small hours of the morning are breaking, and Labby is in
his most genial mood&mdash;when he is ready to declare that, after
all, he is only a Conservative in disguise, and that his
Radicalism is merely put on for the purpose of amusing and
catching the groundlings. As a matter of fact, Labby is by
instinct one of the most thorough Radicals that ever breathed.
His Radicalism, it is true, is of the antique pattern. He is
an individualist without compromise or concession. Life to
him is to the strongest; he has no faith save in the gospel
of the survival of the fittest. Equable and even cheery, he
does not take a particularly joyous view of human existence.
I have heard him speak of the emptiness and futilities of
human existence in tones, not of gloom, for he is too much
of a philosopher to indulge in regrets, but with a hearty
sincerity that would do credit to the Trappist monk who
found everything vanity of vanities in a sinful world.
Despising honours and dignities, he positively loathes outward
show; he is a Radical by instinct and nature. Though
one of the wealthiest men in the House of Commons, nobody
has over known him guilty of one act of ostentation. Probably
he loves power. I have not the smallest doubt that he
would enjoy very well being a Cabinet Minister. But for
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" class="pagenum" title="Page 99"></a>
social distinction, for the frippery and display of life, he has
a positive dislike. He is like Mr. Biggar also in tenacity.</p>

<div class="sn">And the grit.</div>

<p>It <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;most&quot; in the original text">must</ins>
have been a disappointment to him&mdash;it was certainly
a disappointment to his many friends&mdash;that
he was not a member of the Ministry which he
did so much to bring into existence. But the very day the
House met after the formation of the Government, Labby
was in his old place on the front bench below the gangway
as if nothing had occurred&mdash;just as ready as ever to take his
share in the proceedings of the House of Commons. And
every succeeding evening saw him in his place&mdash;listening with
commendable piety to the exhortations of Holy Writ&mdash;given
forth in the fine resonant voice of Archdeacon Farrar&mdash;ready
to seize a point&mdash;to take advantage of a situation, eagerly
interested in everything that is going on. Some people may
regard this as a very common gift. It is nothing of the kind.
I know no place in the world which is a severer test of a
man's tenacity of purpose, than the House of Commons. I
suppose it is because we see the men more publicly there than
elsewhere; but I know no place where there are so many ups
and downs of human destiny as in the House of Commons&mdash;no
place, at all events, where one is so struck with the
changes, and transformations of human destinies. The man
who, in one or two Sessions, is on his legs every moment&mdash;who
takes a prominent part in every debate&mdash;who has become
one of the notabilities of the House&mdash;in a year or two's time
has sunk to a silent dweller apart from all the eagerness and
fever of debate, sinks into melancholy and listlessness, and
is almost dead before he has given up his Parliamentary life.
Staying power is the rarest of all Parliamentary powers;
Labby has plenty of staying power.</p>

<div class="sn">Sir Charles
Dilke.</div>

<p>Another figure which the new House of Commons is
gradually beginning to understand is Sir Charles
Dilke. He is one of the men who seem to have
no interest in life outside politics. When one
thinks that he has wealth, an immense number of subjects in
<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" class="pagenum" title="Page 100"></a>
which he can find instruction and occupation, that he is
familiar with the languages, literature, and life of several
countries, it is hard to understand how he could have had
the endurance to go through the hurricane of abuse and
persecution which he has had to encounter in the last seven
years. There are traces in his face of the intense mental
suffering through which he has passed; there are more lines
about the eyes than should be in the case of a man who is
just fifty. But, otherwise, he positively looks younger than
he did when he was a Cabinet Minister. There is colour
where there used to be nothing but deadly pallor&mdash;freshness
where the long and terrible drudgery of official life had left a
permanent look of fag and weariness. Sir Charles Dilke has
taken up the broken thread of his life just as if nothing had
occurred in that long period of exile and suffering. He is
never out of his place: attends every sitting as conscientiously
as if he were in office and responsible for everything that is
going on; and has his eye on subjects as wide apart as the
parish councils and Newfoundland, army reform and the
occupation of Uganda. It is curious to see, too, how he is
regaining that ascendancy over the House of Commons
which he exercised formerly. It is an ascendancy not due in
the least to oratorical power. Sir Charles Dilke never made
a fine sentence or a sonorous peroration in his whole life. It
is that power of acquiring all the facts of the case&mdash;of being
thoroughly up in all its merits&mdash;in short, of knowing his
business&mdash;which impresses the House of Commons, which,
after all, though it may cheer the gibes of a smart and pert
debater like Mr. Chamberlain, is most happy when it
hears a man talking of something which he understands
thoroughly.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe as a
Jingo.</div>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain spoke, as I have said, in the debate. It
was a very characteristic speech. I know people
think I am prejudiced about this gentleman. Not
in the least. I recognize that he has many
splendid qualities for political life. They are not qualities
<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" class="pagenum" title="Page 101"></a>
which I think highest either in the oratorical or the intellectual
sense. He also has staying power, and has gone through
seven terrible years. There is the trace of all the bitterness
of that struggle in his face&mdash;which has lost in these years the
almost boyish freshness of expression and outline, which
bears in every deep line a mark of the ferocity of the passions
by which his breast has been torn. He is one of the many
men in the House of Commons that give one the impression
of being hunted by the worst and most pitiless of all furies&mdash;violent
personal passion&mdash;especially for power, for triumph,
for revenge. But still, there he is&mdash;ready as ever to take
part in the struggle&mdash;still holding the position he held seven
years ago&mdash;with no sign of weakening or repentance, though
there be plenty of the hunger of baulked revenge.</p>

<div class="sn">The tragedy
of politics.</div>

<p>What a pity it is we can't see some of those great political
figures in the nudity of their souls. They must
have many a bitter moment&mdash;many an hour of
dark and hopeless depression&mdash;probably far more
than other men; for them emphatically life is a conflict and
a struggle. And the conflict and the struggle often kill them
long before their time. Was there ever anything much more
tragic than the cry of M. Ferry for &quot;le grand Repos,&quot; as
he lay stifling from the weakening heart which the bullet of a
political enemy and the slings and arrows of years of calumny
and persecution had at last broken? To any man with
ordinary sensitiveness of nerves, a political career is a crucifixion&mdash;many
times repeated. But Mr. Chamberlain, probably,
has not the ordinary sensitiveness of nerves. Combative,
masterful, with narrow and concentrated purpose, he pursues
the game of politics&mdash;not without affliction, but with persistent
tenacity and a courage that have rarely shown any
signs of faltering or failing.</p>

<p>All these things must be granted to Mr. Chamberlain;
but when I come to speak of him intellectually, I cannot see
anything in him but a very perky, smart, glib-tongued
&quot;drummer,&quot; who is able to pick up the crumbs of knowledge
<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" class="pagenum" title="Page 102"></a>
with extraordinary rapidity, and give them forth again with
considerable dexterity. He speech on Uganda, so far as its
thought and its phraseology were concerned, was on the level
of the profound utterances with which Sir Ashmead Bartlett
tickles and infuriates the groundlings of provincial audiences.
But it took the House&mdash;at least, it took the Tories; and,
after all, what party orators who have not the responsibilities
of office have to do, is to get cheers and embarrass the
Government.</p>

<div class="sn">Another
hymn to
the G.O.M.</div>

<p>The reader must not be either exasperated or bored if he
finds continuous mention of the G.O.M. in these
pages, for he is, to a great extent, the House of
Commons. I remember hearing Mrs. Gladstone
once use of her distinguished husband a phrase which gave
tersely and simply a complete idea of a side of his character.
It was just before his historic visit to Birmingham, and there
was anxiety as to the vast size of the great Bingley Hall in
which it had been decided he was to speak. &quot;He has such
heart,&quot; said Mrs. Gladstone of her husband&mdash;meaning that
whatever was the size of the hall, he would do his best, at
whatever cost, to fill it with his voice. It is this mighty
heart of his which carries him through everything, and which
largely accounts for the hold he has over the imaginations
and hearts of the masses. Well, one can see proof of this in
his conduct whenever he is leader of a Government. Other
Prime Ministers and leaders of the House are only too willing
to leave as much of the work as possible to their subordinates.
Disraeli used to lie in Oriental calm during the greater part
of every sitting, leaving all his lieutenants to do the drudgery
while he dosed and posed. Not so Gladstone. He is almost
literally always on his legs. The biggest bore&mdash;the rudest
neophyte&mdash;the most gulping obstructive is certain of an
answer from him&mdash;courteous, considerate, and ample. No
debate, however small, is too petty for his notice and intervention;
in short, he tries to do not only his own work, but
everybody else's.</p>

<div><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" class="pagenum" title="Page 103"></a></div>
<div class="sn">His justification.</div>

<p>I have once or twice gently suggested that I thought the
G.O.M. might leave a little more to his subordinates,
and spare that frame and mind which
bears the Atlantean burden of the Home Rule
struggle. But Mr. Gladstone is able to unexpectedly justify
himself when his friends are crying out in remonstrance; and
it is, too, one of the peculiarities of this extraordinary portent
of a man&mdash;extraordinary physically as much as mentally&mdash;that
the more he works, the fresher and happier he seems to
be. If you see him peculiarly light-hearted; if he be gesticulating
with broad and generous sweep on the Treasury
Bench; if he be whispering to Sir William Harcourt, and
then talking almost aloud to Mr. John Morley&mdash;above all, if
he be ready to meet all comers, you may be quite sure that he
has just delivered a couple of rattling and lengthy speeches,
in which, with his deadly skill and perfect temper, he has
devastated the whole army of false arguments with which his
opponents have invaded him. So, for instance, it was on
March 28th. It was noticed that he was not in the House
for some hours during the discussion of the Vote on Account.
But, as evening approached, there he was in his place&mdash;fresh,
smiling, happy, every limb moving with all the alertness of
auroral youth. In the interval between his first appearance
in the House and then later, he had delivered two lengthy
speeches to two deputations of deadly foes; but he came
down after this exertion just as if he had been playing a
game of cricket, and had taken enough physical exercise to
bring blitheness to his spirits and alacrity to his limbs.</p>

<div class="sn">His unending progress.</div>

<p>And then the best of it all is that Mr. Gladstone justifies
his speech-making by improving every hour. It
would scarcely seem credible that a man with
more than half-a-century of speech-making and
triumphs behind him would have been capable of making
any change, and especially of making a change for the
better. But the peculiarity of Mr. Gladstone is that even
as a speaker he grows and improves every day. I have
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" class="pagenum" title="Page 104"></a>
been watching him closely now for some sixteen years
in the House of Commons, and I thought that it was impossible
for him to ever reach again the triumphs of some of his
utterances. I have heard people say, too, that they felt it
pathetic to hear him deliver his speech on the introduction of
the Home Rule Bill, and to remember the vigour with which
his utterances on that occasion stood in such a contrast.
This was superficial and false criticism. It is quite true that
the old resonance of the voice is not there, and it is true that
now and then he shows signs of physical fatigue, and that
recently after his cold there were some days when his voice
was little better than a very distinct, but also a very pathetic,
whisper. But there is another side. Age has mellowed his
style, so that now he can speak on even the most contentious
subject with a gentleness and a freedom from anything like
venom&mdash;with an elevation of tone&mdash;that make it almost impossible
for even his bitterest opponent to listen to him without
delight and, for the moment at least, with a certain
degree of assent. If anybody really wishes to find out what
constitutes the highest and most effective form of House of
Commons' eloquence, he should spend his days in listening to
Mr. Gladstone in the most recent style he has adopted in the
House of Commons. And the lessons to be derived are that
House of Commons' eloquence should be easy, genial in
temper, reserved in force&mdash;in short, that it should put things
with the agreeable candour, and passionlessness want of
exaggeration which characterise well-bred conversation.</p>

<div class="sn">To the
slaughter.</div>

<p>A foredoomed sheep could not have been brought more
unwillingly to the slaughter than was Mr. Balfour
to the debate on the Vote of Censure. He had
nothing new to say, and unfortunately he felt
that as keenly as anybody else. Every single topic with
which he had to deal had been discussed already, until people
were positively sick of them&mdash;in short, poor Mr. Balfour was
in the position of having to serve up to the House a dish that
had been boiled and grilled and stewed, and yet stewed again,
<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" class="pagenum" title="Page 105"></a>until
the gorge rose at it in revolt and disgust. The late
Chief Secretary has the susceptibility of all nervous temperaments.
The men are indeed few who have equal power with
all kinds of audiences&mdash;with an audience that is friendly and
that is hostile. Still more rare is it to find a man who can
face an audience even worse than a downright hostile one,
and that is an audience which is indifferent, There are very
few men I have known in my Parliamentary experience who
could do it.</p>

<div class="sn">A memory of
Parnell.</div>

<p>Mr. Parnell was one. I have seen him speak quite comfortably
to an audience which consisted of himself,
Mr. Biggar, the Minister in attendance, and the
Speaker of the House&mdash;in all, four, including
himself. Indeed, he often said to me that he rather liked to
have such an audience. Speaking was not easy or agreeable
to him, and his sole purpose for many years in speaking at all
was to consume so much time. Parnell was a man who
always found it rather hard to concentrate his mind on any
subject unless he was alone and in silence. This was perhaps
one of the many reasons why he kept out of the House of
Commons as much as he could. Anything like noise or disturbance
around him seemed to destroy his power of thinking.
For instance, when he was being cross-examined by Sir
Richard Webster in the course of the Forgeries Commission,
his friends trembled one day because, looking at his face,
with its puzzled, far-away look, they knew that he was in one
of those moods of abstraction, during which he was scarcely
accountable for what he said. And sure enough he made on
that day the appalling statement that he had used certain
language for the purpose of deceiving the House of Commons.
He said to me that he liked to speak in an empty House
because then he had time to collect his thoughts. Joe
Biggar, his associate, was also able to speak in any circumstances
with exactly the same ease of spirit. To him,
speaking was but a means to an end, and whether people
listened to him or not&mdash;stopped to hang on his words or fled
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" class="pagenum" title="Page 106"></a>
before his grating voice and Ulster accent&mdash;it was all one to
him. Two other men have the power of speaking always
with the same interest and self-possession. These are Sir
Charles Dilke and Mr. O'Connor Power.</p>

<div class="sn">The Sensitiveness
of
Mr. Balfour.</div>

<p>But Mr. Balfour is like none of these men. He requires
the glow of a good audience&mdash;of a cheering party&mdash;of
the certainty of success in the division lobby&mdash;to
bring out his best powers. The splendid,
rattling, self-confident debater of the coercion period now no
longer exists, and Mr. Balfour has positively gone back to the
clumsiness, stammering, and ineffectiveness of the pre-historic
period of his life before he had taken up the Chief Secretaryship.
That was bad enough; but what is worse is that
the House is beginning to feel it. If you lose confidence in
yourself, the world is certain to pretty soon follow your
example. And so it is now with Mr. Balfour, for when he
stood up to speak on March 27th there was the sight&mdash;which
must have made his soul sink to even profounder depths of
depression&mdash;of members leaving the House in troops and
rushing to the lobby, the library, or the smoke-room, rather
than listen to a debater whose rise a few months ago would
have meant a general and excited incursion of everybody that
could hear. Starting thus, Mr. Balfour made the worst of a
bad case, his speech was a failure, and as the American would
put it, a fizzle; in short, a ghastly business.</p>

<div class="sn">The G.O.M.'s
outburst.</div>

<p>It was in the midst of this debate that Mr. Gladstone
made his magnificent and unexpected outburst.
He had been paying attention to the debate&mdash;but
very quietly, and not at all in a way that suggested
an idea of intervening in it. It was, too, about nine
o'clock when Mr. Gladstone stood up, and anybody
acquainted with the House of Commons knows that nine
o'clock is in the very crisis of that dinner hour which
nightly makes the House of Commons a waste and a wilderness.
Nor, indeed, was there much in the opening sentences
that seemed to indicate the fact&mdash;the great fact&mdash;that the
<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" class="pagenum" title="Page 107"></a>
House of Commons was about to listen to one of the most
extraordinary manifestations of eloquence it has ever heard
during its centuries of existence. For the Old Man was in
his most benignant mood. He spoke of his opponents and
their case in sorrow rather than in anger. Evidently, the
House was about to listen to one of those delightful little
addresses&mdash;half paternal, half pedagogic&mdash;to which it has
become accustomed in recent years, since Mr. Gladstone
threw off the fierce, warring spirit of earlier days, and
became the honey-tongued Nestor of the assembly. But, as
time went on, the House began to perceive that the Old Man
was in splendid fighting trim, and seized with one of those
moments of positive inspiration, in which he carries away an
assembly as though it were floated into Dreamland on the
waves of a mighty magician's magic power. Smash after
smash came upon the Tory case&mdash;as though you could see
the whole edifice crumbling before your eyes, as though it
were an earthquake slitting the rocks and shaking the solid
earth. And, all the time, no loss whatever of the massive
calm, the imperturbable good-humour, the deadly politeness
which the commercial gentlemen from Ulster have also
found can kill more effectively than the shout of rhetoric,
or the jargon of faction, or the raucous throat of bigotry.</p>

<div class="sn">In the
Empyrean.</div>

<p>At last the Old Man had come to a contrast between the
action of the Tory Government of 1885 and the
Liberal with regard to the treatment of prisoners
in Ireland. The history of that period is one upon
which Mr. Gladstone is now able to speak without feeling;
but he dragged out from that period and its hidden recesses
the whole story of the negotiations between Parnell
and Lord Carnarvon, and all the other circumstances that
make that one of the most remarkable epochs in the history
of English parties. He was now sweeping all before him.
This Lord Randolph felt, and it was almost timorously he
rose to make an interruption. The Old Man courteously
gave way; but it was only to jump up again and pour on
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" class="pagenum" title="Page 108"></a>
his young opponent a tide of ridicule and answer which
overwhelmed him. Higher and higher he soared with every
succeeding moment, and stranger and more impressive
became the aspect of the House. There is nothing which
becomes that assembly so much as those moments of exaltation
during which it is under the absolute spell of some
great master of its emotions. Then a death-like stillness
falls upon it&mdash;you can almost hear the same heavy-drawn
sighs as those that in a Paris opera-house tell of all the
passion, the flood of memory and regret, and the dreams
which are evoked by the voice of a Marguerite before her
final expiation&mdash;of a Juliet before her final immolation.
Laughter and cheers there were in abundance during this
portion of Mr. Gladstone's speech; but the general demeanour
was one of deadly stillness and rapt emotion&mdash;the
stillness one can imagine on that Easter morning when De
Quincey went forth and washed the fever from his forehead
with the dew of early day.</p>

<div class="sn">An episode.</div>

<p>And in the midst of it all there came one of the most
pathetic little episodes I have seen in the House
of Commons of recent years. Mr. Gladstone has
somewhat changed his habits in one respect. There was a
time when he rarely came to the House to deliver a great
speech without a little bottle&mdash;such as one sees containing
pomade on the dressing-table of the thin-haired bachelor. Of
late, the pomade-bottle has disappeared. The G.O.M. is
now content to take the ordinary glass of water. It is very
seldom that he requires even that amount of sustenance
during his great speeches. However, he had been doing a
good deal that day&mdash;he had already made a long speech to
his supporters in the Foreign Office&mdash;and he required a glass
of water. He called out for it, and, at once, there was a
rush from the Treasury Bench to the lobby outside. But,
before this could be done, the very pleasant little episode to
which I have alluded took place. There stood opposite Mr.
Jackson, the late Chief Secretary, an untouched glass of
<a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" class="pagenum" title="Page 109"></a>
water. When he heard the cry of the Old Man, Mr. Jackson&mdash;who
has plenty of Yorkshire kindliness, as well as Yorkshire
bluffness&mdash;at once took up the glass that stood before
him, and handed it across the table. With a bow, and a
delighted and delightful smile, the Old Man took the glass,
and drank almost greedily. And then, turning to his
opponents, he said, &quot;I wish the right hon. gentleman who
uses me so kindly, were as willing to take from my fountainhead
as I am from his.&quot; The grace, the courtesy, the
readiness with which it was said, took the House by storm,
and it was hard to say whether the delighted laughter and
cheers came in greater volume from the Tory or the Liberal
side of the House.</p>

<div class="sn">The
peroration.</div>

<p>And Mr, Gladstone's power increased with his power
over the House. It looked as if you were
watching some mighty monarch of the air that
rises and rises higher, higher into the empyrean
on slow-poised, even almost motionless, wing. Leaving behind
the narrow issues of the particular motion before the
House, Mr. Gladstone entered on a rapid survey of the
mournful and touching relations between English officialism
and Irish National sentiment. From the dead past, he
called up the touching, beautiful, and sympathetic figure of
Thomas Drummond, and all his efforts to reconcile the
administration of the law with the rights and sentiments
of the Irish people. The time for cheering had passed. All
anybody could do was to listen in
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;spell-bound&quot; in the original text">spellbound</ins>
silence, as
sonorous sentence rolled after sonorous sentence. And then
cams the end, in a softer and lower key. It was a direct
personal allusion to Mr. Morley. It was the whole weight of
the Government and of its head thrown to the side of the
Chief Secretary in the new policy in Ireland. &quot;We claim,&quot;
said Mr. Gladstone, &quot;to be partakers of his responsibility,
we appeal to the judgment of the House of Commons, and
we have no other desire except to share his fate.&quot; And
then a hurricane of applause.</p>

<div><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" class="pagenum" title="Page 110"></a></div>
<div class="sn">A first
experience.</div>

<p>It was impossible not to feel sympathy for Lord
Randolph Churchill in the difficult task of
following such a speech. The first thing he had
to do was to bear testimony to the extraordinary
effect the speech had made upon the House of Commons.
It was, he said, a speech &quot;impressive and entrancing&quot;&mdash;two
most happily-chosen epithets to describe it. And then Lord
Randolph told a little bit of personal history which was
interesting. In all his Parliamentary career, this was the
first time he had been called upon to immediately follow a
speech of Mr. Gladstone. He would willingly have abandoned
the opportunity, for it was a speech which no man in
the House of Commons was capable of confronting. After it,
everything else was bound to fall flat, dull, and unimpressive.
Lord Randolph had the misfortune of having prepared a
speech of considerable length&mdash;going into the dead past,
forgotten things, and found himself&mdash;almost for the first
time in his life&mdash;incapable of holding the attention of the
House of Commons. Then the division followed, with 47 of
a majority&mdash;and loud ringing cheers came from the friends
of the Government&mdash;and especially from the Irish benches&mdash;represented
in the division by every single member of the
party, with the exception of one, absent on sick leave.</p>

<h3>THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.</h3>


<div class="sn">Still holiday-making.</div>

<p>The Easter holidays were slow in coming to an end. People
who were fortunate enough to obtain pairs,
lingered by the seaside or in the country
house. Others were busy with the work which
the recess now imposes as much as in the most feverish
Parliamentary times on leading political men. Mr. Balfour
was away in Ireland, among the Orangemen of Ulster and
the Loyalists of Dublin; Lord Randolph Churchill was at
Liverpool making silly and violent speeches; Mr. Chamberlain
was <i>colloguing</i>&mdash;to use an excellent Irish phrase&mdash;with
the publicans of the Midlands. The Irish were especially
conspicuous by the smallness of their attendance. They had
been months away from business, wives, children, and
naturally they were anxious to take advantage of the brief
breathing space which was left to them before that time
came when they could not leave Westminster for a moment
in the weeks during which the Home Rule Bill was in
Committee!</p>

<div class="sn">Return of
the G.O.M.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, of course, was in his place. Down in
Brighton, in a pot-hat, antediluvian in age and
shape, he had been courting the breeze of the
sea under the hospitable wing of Mr. Armitstead;
escaping from the crowds of hero-worshippers, and attending
divine service sometimes twice in the same day. He had
<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" class="pagenum" title="Page 112"></a>
not been idle in his temporary retreat. When the day comes
to record his doings before the accurate scales of Omnipotent
and Omniscient Justice, he will stand out from all other
men in the absolute use of every available second of his days
of life. It was clear that during his retreat, as during his
hours of official work, his mind had been busy on the same
absorbing and engrossing subject. He was armed with a
considerable manuscript, and had evidently thought out his
sentences, his arguments, his statements of facts with intense
devotion and thought.</p>

<p>This is one of the things which distinguishes him from
other public men of his time. There are men I wot of&mdash;and
not very big men either&mdash;who are nothing without their
audience. They deem their dignity abused if there be not
the crowded bench, the cheering friends, the prominent
and ostentatious place. Not so Mr. Gladstone. Perhaps
it is the splendid robustness of his nerves, perhaps the
absorption in his subject to the forgetfulness of himself;
whatever it is, he faces this small, <i>distrait</i>, perhaps even
depressed, audience with the same zest as though he were
once again before that splendid gathering which met his eyes
on the memorable night when he brought in his Home Rule
Bill. Who but he could fail to have noticed the contrast,
and noticing, who but he could remain so loftily unobservant
and unimpressed?</p>

<div class="sn">In splendid
form.</div>

<p>But then Mr. Gladstone has too much of that splendid
oratorical instinct not to fashion and shape his
speech to the change in the surroundings. He
has an impressionability&mdash;not to panic, not to
depression, not to wounded vanity, but to the appropriateness
and the demands of an environment, which is something
miraculous. I have already remarked, that the infinite variety
of his oratory is Shakespearian in its completeness and
abundance. The speech on April 6th was an additional
proof of this. Comparisons were naturally made between
this speech and the speech by which he introduced the Bill,
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" class="pagenum" title="Page 113"></a>
and everybody who was competent thought that the second
speech was the finer and better of the two. Stories have
trickled through to the public of the anxieties and worries
with which Mr. Gladstone was confronted&mdash;not from the
Irish side&mdash;on the very night before he had to bring forth
this prodigious piece of legislative work. It is these small
worries that to many Statesmen are the grimmest realities
and the most momentous and effective events of their inner
lives. It is reported that one of the few sleepless nights
which have ever disturbed the splendidly even and sane and
healthy tenor of this tempestuous and incessantly active life,
was the night before the introduction of the Home Rule
Bill. There are points to be finally settled&mdash;clauses to be
ultimately fixed&mdash;phrases to be polished or pared at the
eleventh hour in all human affairs. Measures finally settled
and fixed for weeks before the last hour exist&mdash;like all perfection&mdash;only
in the brains and pages of dramatists and
novelists.</p>

<div class="sn">Sunburnt,
vigorous, self-possessed.</div>

<p>It was not unnatural under these circumstances that
when Mr. Gladstone made his speech introducing
the Home Rule Bill there should have been on
his cheek a pallor deadlier even than that which
usually sits upon his brow. That pallor, by the way, I heard
recently, has been characteristic of him from his earliest
years. A schoolfellow from that far-off and almost pre-historic
time when our Grand Old Man was a thin, slim, introspective
and prematurely serious boy at Eton, tells to-day that the
recollection he has of the young Gladstone is of a slight
figure, never running, but always walking with a fast step,
with earnest black eyes, and with a pallid face&mdash;the ivory
pallor, be it observed, not of delicacy, but of robustness. Still
there was on that Home Rule night, a pallor that had the
deadlier hue of sleeplessness, worry, over-anxiety&mdash;the hideous
burden of a great, weighty, and complex speech to deliver.</p>

<p>On April 6th all this was gone. The fresh, youthful,
cheerful man who stood up in his place had drunk deep of the
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" class="pagenum" title="Page 114"></a>
breezes that sweep The Front at Brighton; his cheeks were
burned by the blaze of a splendid spring sun; in the budding,
blossoming vital air around him he had taken some of that
eternal hopefulness with which the new birth of nature in
the spring inspires every human being with any freshness of
sensation left. Perchance from his windows in the Lion
Mansion he had looked in the evening over the broad expanse
of frontierless waters, and risen to the exaltation of the chainless
unrest, the tireless and eternal youth, the illimitable
breadth of the sea. At all events, he stood before the House
visibly younger, brighter, serener than for many a day.</p>

<p>The voice bore traces of the transformation of body and
soul which this short visit to the sea has produced. It
was soft, mellow, strong. There were none of the descents
to pathetic and inaudible whispers which occasionally in the
hours of fag and fatigue have painfully impressed the
sympathetic hearer. As Mr. Gladstone subdued himself to
the temper of the House, the House accommodated itself to the
tone of Mr. Gladstone. I have heard his speech on the
second reading described as a pleasant, delightful, historical
lecture. Certainly, no stranger coming to the House would
have imagined that these sentences, flowing in a beautiful,
even stream, dealt with one of the conflicts of our time which
excite the fiercest passion and bitterest blood. It is this
calmness that is now part of Mr. Gladstone's strength. It
soothes and kills at the same time.</p>

<div class="sn">The Nestor-patriot.</div>

<p>The evening was soft and sunny, the air of the House
subdued, and the absence of anything like large
numbers prevented outbursts of party passion.
And yet all this seemed to heighten the effectiveness
of the scene and the speech. Once again one had to
think of Mr. Gladstone&mdash;as posterity will think of him at
this splendid epoch of his career&mdash;not as the party politician,
giving and receiving hard blows&mdash;riding a whirlwind of
passion&mdash;facing a hurricane of hate&mdash;but as the Nestor-patriot
of his country, telling all parties alike the gospel that
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" class="pagenum" title="Page 115"></a>
will lead to peace, prosperity, and contentment. The Tories,
doubtless, see none of this; but even they cannot help falling
into the mood of the hour, and under the fascination of the
speaker. Now and then they interrupt, but, as a rule, they
sit in respectful and awed silence. Whenever they do venture
on interruption, the old lion shows that he is still in possession
of all that power for a sudden and deadly spring, which
lies concealed under the easy and tranquil strength of the
hour. He happens to mention the case of Norway and
Sweden as one of the cases which confirm his contention
that autonomy produces friendly relations. He has to
confess, that in this case some difficulties have arisen; there
is a faint Tory cheer. At once&mdash;but with gentle good humour&mdash;with
an indulgent smile&mdash;Mr. Gladstone remarks that he
doesn't wonder that the Tories clutch at the smallest straw
that helps them to eke out a case against autonomy, and then
he proceeds to show that even the case of Norway and
Sweden doesn't help them a bit.</p>

<div class="sn">A vivid
gesture.</div>

<p>There is another little touch which will bring out the
perfection and beauty of the speech. One of the
things which tell the experienced observer that
Mr. Gladstone is in his best form, is the exuberance
and freedom of his gesture. Whenever he feels a
thorough grip of himself and of the House, he lets himself
go in a way upon which he does not venture in quieter moods.
He was dealing with the question of our colonies and of the
difference which had been made in them by the concession of
Home Rule. It was while thus engaged that he made one of
those eloquent little asides, which bring home to the mind the
vastness and extent of this great career. Nearly sixty years
ago&mdash;just think of it, nearly sixty years ago&mdash;he had been
associated with the Government of the Colonies&mdash;referring
to the time when Lord Aberdeen was his chief, and he held
office for the first time as an Under-Secretary. And then he
made from Lord Aberdeen a quotation in which the Colonial
Secretary calls delighted attention to the fact that Heligoland
<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" class="pagenum" title="Page 116"></a>
is tranquil&mdash;the single one of all the dependencies of the
Crown of which that could be said at that moment.</p>

<p>But it was not at this point that the significant gesture
came in, to which I have alluded. Mr. Gladstone had another
document to read. By the way&mdash;even over the distance
which divides the Treasury Bench from the Opposition
Benches below the gangway, where we Irishry sit&mdash;I could
see that the document was written in that enormous hand-writing,
which is necessary nowadays when the sight of the
Prime Minister is not equal to the undimmed lustre of the
eagle eye. This letter, said Mr. Gladstone, was not addressed
to him. It was not addressed to a Home Ruler. By this
time, curiosity was keenly excited. But Mr. Gladstone&mdash;smiling,
holding the House in firm attention and rapt admiration&mdash;was
determined to play with the subject a little longer.
The letter was not directed even to the Commoner. It was
directed to a &quot;Peer;&quot; and as he uttered this sacred word,
with a delicious affectation of reverence, he raised the index
finger of his hand to high heaven, as though only a reference
to a region so exalted could sufficiently manifest the elevation
of the personage who had been the recipient of the letter.
The House saw the point, and laughed in great delight. It
is on occasions like these that one sees the immense artistic
power which lies under all the seriousness and gravity of Mr.
Gladstone&mdash;the thorough exuberance of vitality which marks
the splendid sanity of his healthy nature.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Birrell.</div>

<p>I always tremble when I see a literary man, and especially
a literary man with a high reputation, rise to
address the House of Commons. The shores of
that cruel assembly are strewn with the wrecks of literary
reputations. It was, therefore, not without trepidation that
I saw Mr. Augustin Birrell&mdash;one of the very finest writers of
our time&mdash;succeed in catching the Speaker's eye. My misgivings
were entirely unnecessary. With perfect ease and
self-possession&mdash;at the same time with the modesty of real
genuine ability&mdash;Mr. Birrell made one of the happiest and
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" class="pagenum" title="Page 117"></a>
best speeches of the debate. Now and then, the epigram was
perhaps a little too polished&mdash;the wit perhaps a trifle too
subtle for the House of Commons. But careful preparation
always involves this; and every man must prepare until he is
able to think more clearly on his legs than sitting down. It
was just the kind of speech which was wanted at a moment when
the general air is rent with the rhodomontade and tomfoolery
of Ulster. Applying to these wild harangues the destructively
quiet wit of <i>obiter dicta</i>, Mr. Birrell made the Orangemen look
very foolish and utterly ridiculous. Mr, Gladstone was one
of Mr. Birrell's most attentive and cordial hearers. Mr.
Birrell is going to do great things in the House of Commons.</p>

<div class="sn">In penal
servitude.</div>

<p>The keen, playful, and penetrating wit of Mr. Birrell did
not do anything for Mr. Dunbar Barton. Mr.
Barton is&mdash;as he properly boasted&mdash;the descendant
of some of that good Protestant stock
that, in the days of the fight over the destruction of the Irish
Parliament, stood by the liberties of Ireland. He is a
nephew of Mr. Plunket&mdash;he inherits the talent which is
traditional in the Plunket family, and is said not to be without
some of the national spirit that still hides itself in odd
nooks and corners of estranged Irish minds. But he has
none of the saving grace of his country or family. A solemn
voice that seems to come from the depths of some divine
despair, and from the recesses of his innermost organs,
together with a certain funereal aspect in the close-shaven
face, gives him an air that suggests the cypress and the
cemetery. But with deadly want of humour, he spoke of the
possibility of his spending the remainder of a blameless life in
penal servitude, and was deeply wounded when the uproarious
and irreverent House refused to take the possibility seriously.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Stansfeld.</div>

<p>The following Friday was made memorable by a fine
speech from Mr. Stansfeld. Full of activity,
with undimmed eye, with every mental faculty
keen and alert, with every lofty and generous
aspiration as fresh as in the days of hot and perilous youth,
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" class="pagenum" title="Page 118"></a>
Mr. Stansfeld yet appears something of a survival in the
House of Commons. His appearance, his style of speech,
even the framework of his thought, seem to belong to another&mdash;in
some respects a finer and more passionate period than
our own. The long hair combed straight back&mdash;the strong
aquiline nose&mdash;the heavy-lined and sensitive mouth&mdash;the
subdued tenderness and wrath of the eyes&mdash;even the somewhat
antique cut of the clothes&mdash;suggest the days when the
storm and stress of the youthful century were still in men's
souls, and were driving them to conspiracy, to prison, to
scaffold, to barricades, to bloody fields. There is also a deliberation
in the delivery&mdash;a sonorousness in the phraseology&mdash;that
has something of a bygone day. But all this adds to
the impressiveness of the address. The fervour is all there,
the unalterable conviction, the lofty purpose. There is reason
for the warm note of welcome which comes from the Irish
benches; for this man&mdash;perhaps disappointed&mdash;perchance not
too well used&mdash;stands up to defend his principles with the
same utter forgetfulness of self which belongs only to the
finest and the truest natures.</p>

<div class="sn">Commercial
culture.</div>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain has not a wide range of ideas, and his
small stock has not been increased by anything
like extensive reading. The House was relieved
to find after his return to Westminster on the
10th of April that he had just begun to read Tennyson. It is
always easy to know when Mr. Chamberlain is making the
acquaintance of an author for the first time. Strictly business-like
in even his reading, he apparently first thinks of
reading a book when he has somewhere seen a quotation from
it which might be worked into a speech; the next and almost
immediate process is to transfer it to one of his speeches.
This is one of the many differences between him and the exhaustless
brain and universal reading of Mr. Gladstone. It
was, therefore, not much of a surprise to those who had
watched Mr. Chamberlain for years, to see that he was
making a very bad and poor speech on the second reading of
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" class="pagenum" title="Page 119"></a>
the Home Rule Bill&mdash;a speech certainly far inferior to that
which he had delivered on the first reading. He had exhausted
the poor soil; he had really no more to say. He was
unfortunately helped by Mr. Gladstone, who, instead of
listening in silence to attacks grown stale by their infinite
repetition, attempted to correct some of Mr. Chamberlain's
statements. This was especially the case in reference to the
famous speech in which Mr. Parnell is spoken of as passing
&quot;through rapine to dismemberment.&quot; Mr. Chamberlain
wished to insist that the language had been applied to all
the Irish leaders: Mr. Gladstone insisted that they were
applied to Mr. Parnell alone. This controversy between the
Prime Minister and Mr. Chamberlain gave a little life to a
speech that hitherto had been falling desperately flat, and as
such the interruption was a tactical mistake.</p>

<div class="sn">De mortuis.</div>

<p>But it brought with curious unexpectedness a scene not
without pathos and significance. In the midst of
the thrust and ripost of Mr. Gladstone and Mr.
Chamberlain, a strange and yet familiar voice was heard to
shout out, &quot;They put all the blame on Parnell because he is
dead.&quot; It was a startling&mdash;even an embarrassing interruption.
The memory of Parnell is still dear to the vast
majority of the old comrades who were compelled to separate
themselves from him in the Great Irish Disruption. At the
time when Mr. Gladstone made the speech quoted, Mr.
Parnell was the loved leader of the whole Irish people and a
united Irish party; and the speech was made at a moment
particularly solemn and glorious in the strange life and career
of Parnell. The great controversy between the English and
the Irish leader, which Mr. Chamberlain had raked up from
the almost forgotten past, took place at the moment when
Mr. Parnell had gone from town to town and county to
county in Ireland, in the midst of vast and enthusiastic receptions&mdash;imperial
demonstrations&mdash;with salvoes of cheers,
enthusiasm, and auroral hope such as have taken place so
often in Irish history on the eve of some mighty victory or
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" class="pagenum" title="Page 120"></a>
hideous disaster. And, then, immediately after came Parnell's
imprisonment, which he bore so well&mdash;the suppression
of the National Land League, and the era of unchecked and
ferocious coercion in which the good intentions and kindly
feelings of Mr. Forster finally were buried. To separate themselves
from Mr. Parnell at that great moment in his and their
life, was a thing which none of Parnell's old comrades could
do; and when this startling interruption came, it was the
spoken utterance of many of their thoughts brought back by
Mr. Chamberlain's venomous tongue in painful reverie over a
glorious but dead moment, and a tragically wrecked and
superb career.</p>

<div class="sn">Crocodile
tears.</div>

<p>There was a painful pause, and then came, however, an
antidote. It was not in the Irish Nationalist
party&mdash;it was not in even his own colleagues in
the small band of Parnell's supporters, that Mr.
Redmond's observation found a responsive echo. A tempest
of cheers broke forth from the Tory Benches&mdash;from the
backers of the <i>Times</i> and the supporters of Piggott; and to
add to the painful and almost hideous irony of the situation,
Mr. Chamberlain made unctuous profession of sympathy with
the vindication of Parnell's memory. To those who know
that of all the fierce animosities and contempts of Parnell,
Mr. Chamberlain's was perhaps the fiercest&mdash;to those who
remember that strange and almost awful scene when Mr.
Parnell&mdash;in one of those outbursts of concentrated rage which
it was almost appalling to witness&mdash;turned and rent Mr.
Chamberlain as first false to his colleagues and then false to
Parnell himself&mdash;to those who remembered that deadly pallor
that made even more ghastly the ordinarily pale cheek of Mr.
Chamberlain beneath this withering attack&mdash;to those, I say,
who remembered all this, nothing could be more grotesque
than Mr. Chamberlain shedding a pious tear over Parnell's
grave.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Gladstone
and
Parnell.</div>

<p>The situation passed off, but in many breasts it had left
its sadness and its sting behind. And then it was that
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" class="pagenum" title="Page 121"></a>
once more the Old Man brought back the House to the temper
from which it had been carried by the malignities
of Mr. Chamberlain. Very pale, very calm,
and, at the same time, with evident though sternly
repressed emotion&mdash;even in the very height and ecstasy of
Parliamentary passion there is a splendid composure and
self-command about Mr. Gladstone that conveys an overwhelming
sense of the extraordinary masculinity and strength
of his nature&mdash;very pale, and very calm, Mr. Gladstone stood
up. Speaking in low and touching tones he asked to make
an explanation, because he feared that some observations of
his might have given pain to gentlemen who were deeply
attached to the memory of Mr. Parnell. Then he stated that
while he had formed an opinion, which might be right or
wrong, with regard to Mr. Parnell before his imprisonment
in Kilmainham, he had always believed, after his release, that
Mr. Parnell was working honestly for the good of Ireland;
that he had made a communication to Mr. Parnell to that
effect through a friend; and that from that time forward no
hard word could be found in his speeches with regard to the
Irish leader. This little speech was uttered with exquisite
dignity and kindliness, and Mr. Redmond received it with the
handsomest acknowledgment of its gentleness and grace.</p>

<div class="sn">No manipulating.</div>

<p>This episode has made me anticipate a little, and almost
tempted me to pass by one of the incidents in the
speech of Mr. Chamberlain. But that would have
been a mistake, for it is an incident that brings
out fully the reason why he is so utterly disliked and distrusted
even in those Tory circles which, for the moment, are
making use of him. It is an incident that likewise throws a
flood of light upon the inner, hidden, dark depths of his
sinister nature. He was arguing on the financial aspects of
Mr. Gladstone's Bill. Under this portion of the Bill the
trader who has residences in both countries is entitled to
make his return for his income-tax in either England or
Ireland. Mr. Chamberlain proceeded to put the case of a
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" class="pagenum" title="Page 122"></a>
trader in that position who wished to embarrass the Irish
Government, and who would wish accordingly to give
England, and not the Irish Exchequer, the advantage of his
income-tax. This he could do, Mr. Chamberlain pointed out,
in the easiest manner imaginable; he could &quot;manipulate his
books.&quot; There it stands; these are the very words he used.
Incredible, everybody would say who didn't know Mr. Chamberlain,
and wasn't told by the evidence of eyes and ears that
the words had actually been uttered. The Irish members
were not slow to seize the point, and to shout aloud at this
revelation of Mr. Chamberlain's nature; and even his Tory
friends shuddered at such a manifestation of the real kind of
man that lies hidden under Mr. Chamberlain's oily and
smooth exterior. At first, he seemed surprised at the visible
shock and tremor and involuntary sense of repulsion which this
odious suggestion awakened on all sides&mdash;then he slowly realized
that he had made a mistake; and, for once, this readiest of
debaters was nonplussed, and even a little abashed.</p>

<div class="sn">The Irish
Members
and the Bill.</div>

<p>Mr. MacCarthy followed Mr. Chamberlain; he spoke just
from ten to fifteen minutes&mdash;plainly, simply, to
the point, and what he had to say was that he
and his friends did look on this Bill as a final
settlement, which Ireland would be honourably pledged to
carry out. Unselfish, straightforward, unpretentious, kindly,
Mr. MacCarthy brought into more vivid contrast the personal
venom&mdash;the ruthless hunger for vengeance and the humiliation
of his enemies&mdash;which came out with almost painful
vividness from the speech to which we had just ceased to
listen. Mr. Gladstone, sitting opposite, attentive and watchful,
was evidently much pleased at the heartiness of Mr.
MacCarthy's acceptance of his great measure.</p>

<div class="sn">Sir George
Trevelyan.</div>

<p>The night wound up with the very best speech I have
ever heard Sir George Trevelyan deliver. Sir
George had to answer violent, fierce, almost
malignant assault; but he did so without ever
uttering a harsh word&mdash;without losing one particle of his
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" class="pagenum" title="Page 123"></a>
courteous and admirable self-control&mdash;he raised the debate of
a great issue to the high place of difference of principles and
convictions, instead of personal bickerings and hideous and
revolting personal animosities. It is the vice of Sir George
Trevelyan as a speaker that he over-prepares&mdash;writing out, as
a rule, nearly every word he has to utter, and often some of
the very best speeches I have heard him deliver have been
spoiled by giving the fatal sense of being spoken essays. The
speech was carefully prepared, and, so far as I could observe,
was even written out; but its grace of diction, its fine
temper, above all, its manly explanation of a change of view
and its close-knit reasoning, made it really one of the very
finest addresses I have heard in the course of many years'
debating.</p>

<div class="sn">Toryism of
the gutter.</div>

<p>And, then, if you wanted to appreciate Sir George Trevelyan
the more, you had only to wait for a few
moments to hear the man who followed him. I
am told on pretty good authority that, next to
Lord Randolph Churchill, the favourite orator of the Tory
provincial platform is Sir Ashmead Bartlett. I can well
believe it. The empty shibboleths&mdash;the loud and blatant
voice&mdash;the bumptious temper&mdash;that make the commoner form
of Tory&mdash;all are there. He is the dramatically complete
embodiment of all the vacuous folly, empty-headed shoutings,
and swaggering patriotism which make up the stock-in-trade
of most provincial Tories. Poor Mr. Balfour was caught by
Sir Ashmead before he had time to escape, and in sheer
decency had to remain while his servile adulator was pouring
on him buckets of butter, which must have appalled and
disgusted him. Indeed, the effect of the bellowings of the
man from Sheffield could be seen in the bent back, the depressed
face, the general air of limpness which overcame the
Tory leader&mdash;as helpless, dejected, bent double, he looked
steadily at the green bench underneath him, and concealed
from the House as much as possible the tell-tale horror of
his face.</p>

<div><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" class="pagenum" title="Page 124"></a></div>
<div class="sn">A portrait
of Michael
Davitt.</div>

<p>On an assembly which had been jaded and almost tortured
by this tremendous display, it was Mr. Davitt's
fortune to come with his first speech in Parliament.
For hour after hour he had sate, very still,
with deeply-lined face, but with a restless and frequent twist
of the heavy dark moustache, that spoke of the intense
nervous strain to which this weary waiting was subjecting
him. Davitt is a man whose face would stand out in bold
relief from any crowd of men, however numerous or remarkable.
He has a narrow face, with high cheek-bones, and the
thick, close black whiskers, beard and moustache, make him
look almost as dark as a Spaniard. The eyes are deep-set,
brilliant, restless&mdash;with infinite lessons of hours of agony,
of loneliness, torture in all the million hours which filled up
his nine years of endless and unbroken gloom in penal servitude.
The frame is slight, well-knit&mdash;the frame of a sturdy
son of the people&mdash;kept taut and thin by the restless nervous
soul within. An empty sleeve hanging by his side tells
the tale of work in the factory in childhood's years,
and of one of the accidents which too often maim the
children of the poor in the manufacturing districts of
England. The voice is strong, deep, and soft; the
delivery slow, deliberate, the style of the English or American
platform rather than of the Irish gathering by the green
hillside.</p>

<div class="sn">Dartmoor.</div>

<p>Altogether, never did there stand before this British
assembly in all its centuries of history, a figure
more interesting, more picturesque, more touching,
above all, more eloquent of a mighty transformation&mdash;of a
great new birth and revolution in the history of two nations.
Go back in memory to the day, when with cropped hair&mdash;with
the broad-arrowed coat, the yellow stockings&mdash;this man
dragged wearily the wheelbarrow in the grim silences under
the sinister skies of Dartmoor, with warders to taunt, or
insult, or browbeat the Irish felon-patriot&mdash;with the very
dregs and scum of our lowest social depths for companions
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" class="pagenum" title="Page 125"></a>
and colleagues&mdash;and then think of this same man standing
up before the supreme and august assembly where the might,
sovereignty, power, and omnipotence of this world-wide
empire are centred, and holding it for more than an hour
and a half under a spell of rapt attention that almost
suggested the high-strung devotion of a religious service in
place of a raging political controversy&mdash;think of this contrast,
and then bless the day and the policy that have made possible
such a transformation.</p>

<div class="sn">Westminster.</div>

<p>I cannot attempt to give all the strong points of a speech
which bristled with strong points at almost
every turn. To the House its entire character
must have come as a surprise. The mass of members that
crowded every bench, and filled the vacancies which Ashmead
Bartlett had made&mdash;Mr. Gladstone sitting attentive on the
Treasury Bench&mdash;Mr. Balfour listening with evident friendliness
and sympathy&mdash;all these were enough to transport any
orator into the realms of high stirring rhetoric, and to attune
the nerves to poetic and exalted flight. But Davitt's nerves
stood the test. Slowly, deliberately, patiently, he developed
a case for the Bill, of facts, figures, historical incident,
pathetic and swift pictures of Irish desolation and suffering,
which would have been worthy of a great advocate placing
a heavy indictment. Now and then there was the eloquence
of finely chosen language&mdash;of a striking fact&mdash;even of a
touching personal aside&mdash;but, as a whole, the speech was a
simple, weighty, careful case against the Union&mdash;based on
the eloquent statistics of diminished population, exiled
millions, devastated homesteads.</p>

<div class="sn">Tragic
comedy.</div>

<p>There were plenty of lighter strains to relieve the deadly
earnestness of a man who had thoroughly thought
out his case. And, curiously enough, these
pleasant sallies nearly all had allusion to those
tragic nine years of penal servitude through which Davitt
has passed. Mr. Dunbar Barton, one of the Orange lawyers,
had spoken of himself as likely to spend the remainder of
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" class="pagenum" title="Page 126"></a>
his days in penal servitude. Mr. Davitt put the threat
gently aside, with the assurance that the hon. and learned
gentleman would probably be one day on the bench, and
that he would advise him not to try to reach the bench by
the dock. The same gentleman had expressed a doubt
whether any constitutional lawyer would hold that he was
guilty either of treason or treason felony, if he took up arms
against Home Rule after it had been passed by both Houses
of Parliament. &quot;Would,&quot; said Mr. Davitt, with quiet pathos,
&quot;I had met such a constitutional authority in the shape of
a judge twenty-three long years ago.&quot;</p>

<div class="sn">A vulgar
and caddish
interruption.</div>

<p>And, finally, what contributed to the marvellous effect
of this speech was its temper and one interruption.
In all the speech there was not one trace of the
bitterness that must often have corroded that
poor soul during the nine years of living death&mdash;even the
allusions to political opponents of to-day were kindly and
gentle. Above all things, the speech was one&mdash;not merely
of an Irish Nationalist, but of a true Democrat&mdash;as desirous
of the happiness of other nationalities and other peoples as
of his own. It was while every part of the House was
listening to this beautiful and touching speech, that a gentleman
called Brookfield&mdash;one of the most offensive of the
narrow and malignant section of Tories&mdash;rose and tried to
trip Davitt up, by alleging that he was reading his speech.
I am told that Mr. Balfour sprang in anger from his seat&mdash;there
was a significant and a pained silence on the
Tory Benches&mdash;there was a loud shout of anger and disgust
from the Liberal and the Irish seats&mdash;with William
O'Brien's voice shouting hoarsely above the tempest,
&quot;The party of gentlemen!&quot; The Speaker showed what
he thought, in that deadly quiet way with which he can
administer a snub, that will never be forgotten. It was
all that was wanted to complete the success of this wonderful
speech.</p>

<div class="sn">Sir John
Rigby.</div>

<p>Then came hand-shakings and clappings on the back,
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" class="pagenum" title="Page 127"></a>
and a light in the eyes of Irish members that told of a
great step forward in the progress of their cause.
To a house thinned by the endless rhodomontade
of a dull Orangeman&mdash;with a style of elocution
to which the House is unaccustomed, and which has
almost every fault delivery could have&mdash;the speech of Sir
John Rigby, the Solicitor-General, was one of the finest and
weightiest utterances delivered on the Bill. The massive head,
the fine face, the rugged sense and leonine strength in face and
figure, lent force to a criticism of extraordinary effectiveness
on the attacks levelled against the Bill. First, the Solicitor-General
took up the wild and whirling statement of one of
the opponents of the Bill, and then coolly&mdash;as though it
were a pure matter of business&mdash;he put in juxtaposition the
enactments of the Bill, and the contrast was as laughter provoking
with all its deadly seriousness, as the conflict between
the story of Falstaff and the contemptuously quiet rejoinder
of Prince Hal. Lord Randolph was taken in hand; he was
soon disposed of. Then Mr. Dunbar Barton was crumpled
up and flung away. Sir Edward Clarke ventured an interruption;
he was crushed in a sentence. It was an admirable
specimen of destructive criticism, and it hugely and palpably
delighted Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Asquith.</div>

<p>Mr. Asquith had intended to speak on April 14th, evening,
but the portentous and prolix Courtney had shut
him out, and he had to wait till the following
evening. The change was, perhaps, desirable, for Mr.
Asquith had thus the opportunity of addressing the House
when it was fresh, vital, and impressionable. In these long
debates the evenings usually became intolerably dull and
oppressive. Though Mr. Asquith was an untried man when
he went into office, in two speeches he succeeded in placing
himself in the very front rank of the debaters and politicians
in the House. Let me say at once that the speech was a
remarkable triumph, and placed Mr. Asquith at a bound
amid not only the orators, but the statesmen of the House of
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" class="pagenum" title="Page 128"></a>
Commons&mdash;the men who have nerve, breadth of view, great
courage, enormous resource.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe's
dustheap.</div>

<p>One of the discoveries of the speech must have been
particularly unpleasant to Mr. Chamberlain. The
gentleman from Birmingham has at last found a
man who does not fear him&mdash;who has a much
finer mind&mdash;wider culture&mdash;who has judgment, temper, and
a vocabulary as copious and as ready as that of Mr. Chamberlain
himself. One had only to look at Mr. Chamberlain
throughout the speech to see how palpable, how painful this
discovery was&mdash;especially to a man to whom politics is
nothing but a mere conflict between contending rivalries and
malignities. Mr. Asquith&mdash;calm, self-possessed, measured&mdash;put
Joe on the rack with a deliberation that was sometimes
almost cruel in its effectiveness and relentlessness; and Joe
was foolish enough to point the severity and success of the
attack by losing his self-control. When Mr. Asquith said
that Joe could find no better employment than that of
&quot;scavenging&quot;&mdash;here was a word to make Joe wince&mdash;&quot;among
the dustheaps&quot; of past speeches, Joe was a sight
to see. A &quot;scavenger&quot;&mdash;this was the disrespectful way in
which those quotations were described which had often roused
the Tory Benches to ecstasies of delight. Joe was so
angered that he could not get over it for some time. &quot;Dustheaps!&quot;
he was heard to be muttering several times in
succession, as if the word positively choked him. Indeed,
throughout Mr. Asquith's speech, whenever the allusions
were made to him, Joe was seen to be muttering under his
teeth. It was the running commentary which he made on
the most effective attack that has been uttered against him;
it was the highest tribute to the severity and success of the
assailant.</p>

<div class="sn">Limp Balfour.</div>

<p>Badly as Mr. Chamberlain bore his punishment, Mr.
Balfour was even worse. It is seldom that the
House of Commons has seen a more remarkable
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" class="pagenum" title="Page 129"></a>
or more effective retort than the happy, dexterous, delightful&mdash;from
the literary point of view, unsurpassable&mdash;parody
which Mr. Asquith made of Mr. Balfour's flagitious incitements
to the men of Belfast. Mr. Asquith put the case of
Mr. Morley going down to a crowd in Cork, and using the
same kind of language. Mr. Balfour, in his speech, had
over and over again used the name of the Deity. &quot;I pray
God,&quot; said the pious leader of the Tory party, as he addressed
the Orangemen. When, in the imaginary speech which
Mr. Asquith put into the mouth of Mr. Morley, he recurred
again and again to the phrase, &quot;I pray God,&quot; there was just
the least lifting of the eyes and lowering of the voice to the
sanctimonious level of the Pharisee which made this part of
the speech not merely a fine piece of oratory, but a splendid
bit of acting. Mr. Balfour's appearance during this portion
of Mr. Asquith's speech was pitiable. His face, with its
pallor&mdash;look of abashed pain&mdash;was tell-tale of the inner
shame which he felt, as thus calmly, coldly, cruelly&mdash;with
extraordinary art, and amid a tempest of
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;cheer&mdash;she&quot; in the original text">cheers&mdash;he</ins>
was
brought by his opponent face to face with realities which lay
underneath his bland and oily phrases.</p>

<div class="sn">Another
unmannerly
interruption.</div>

<p>In the midst of the calm and stately flow of Mr. Asquith's
speech, while the House, spellbound, listened in
awe-struck and rapt silence, suddenly, there was
a commotion, a shout, then the roar of many
voices. The whole thing came upon the House with a
bewildering and dumbfounding surprise; it was as if someone
had suddenly died, or some other sinister catastrophe had
occurred. In a moment, several Irish members&mdash;Mr. Swift
McNeill, Mr. Crilly, and others&mdash;were on their feet, shouting
in accents hoarse with anger, inarticulate with rage. The
Speaker was also on his feet, and, for a while, his shouts of
&quot;Order! Order!&quot; failed to calm the sudden, fierce cyclone.
Above the din, voices were shouting, &quot;Name! Name!&quot; with
that rancorous and fierce note which the House of Commons
knows so well when passion has broken loose, and all the
grim depths of party hate are revealed. At last, it was
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" class="pagenum" title="Page 130"></a>
discovered that Lord Cranborne was the culprit, and that
when Mr. Asquith, amid universal sympathy and assent, was
alluding to the beautiful speech of Mr. Davitt, this most
unmannerly of cubs had uttered the word, &quot;Murderer.&quot;</p>

<div class="sn">A whipped
hound.</div>

<p>If he had not been so unspeakably rude, vulgar,
odious, and impertinent, one might have
almost felt sympathy for Lord Salisbury's son
in the position in which he found himself.
His face is usually pale, but now it had the deadly,
ghastly, and almost green pallor of a man who is condemned
to die. But, amid all the palpable terror, the
Cecil insolence was still there, and Lord Cranborne declared
that, though he had used the phrase, he had not intended it
for the House, and that it was true. Since his relative, Lord
Wolmer, made the lamest and meanest apology the House of
Commons had ever heard, there never had been anything to
equal this. The House groaned aloud in disgust and contempt;
even his own side was as abashed as when Brookfield
sought to interrupt Mr. Davitt. The Speaker, quietly, but
visibly moved and disgusted, at once told the insolent young
creature that this was not sufficient, and that an apology was
due&mdash;to which the Cecil hopeling proceeded to do with as
bad a grace and in as odious a style as it was possible for it
to be done. Mr. Asquith's splendid self-control and mastery of
the House bore the ordeal of even this odious incident, and
he wound up the speech with one of the finest and most
remarkable perorations which has ever been heard in that
great assembly. Calm, self-restrained, almost frigid in
delivery, chaste and sternly simple in language, Mr. Asquith's
peroration reached a height that few men could ever attain.
The still House sate with its members raised to their highest
point of endurance, and it was almost a relief when the
stately flow came to an end, and men were able to relieve

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX" />CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE END OF A GREAT WEEK.</h3>


<div class="sn">Mr. Goschen.</div>

<p>The Tories were not in good heart at the beginning of the
week which saw the second reading of the Home
Rule Bill carried on April 21st, and perhaps it
was owing to this that they put up one of their very best
men. Mr. Goschen I have always held to be one of the
really great debaters of the House of Commons. It is true
that he has almost every physical disadvantage with which an
orator could be cursed. His voice is hoarse, muffled, raucous,
with some reminiscences of the Teutonic fatherland from
which he remotely comes. His shortness of sight amounts
almost to a disability. Whenever he has anything to read he
has to place the paper under his eyes, and even then he finds
it very difficult to read it. His action is like that of a distracted
wind-mill. He beats the air with his whirling arms;
he stands several feet from the table, and moves backwards
and forwards in this space in a positively distracting manner.
And yet he is a great debater.</p>

<div class="sn">In
Opposition.</div>

<p>But Mr. Goschen, like every other orator of the Opposition,
has fallen on somewhat evil days, and is not at
his very best now. &quot;The world,&quot; said Thackeray
long ago, &quot;is a wretched snob, and is especially
cold to the unsuccessful.&quot; This applies to that portion of the
world which changes sides in the House of Commons according
to the resolves of the popular verdict. Mr. Goschen, then,
is not seen at his best in these days when all his arguments
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" class="pagenum" title="Page 132"></a>
can receive the triumphant and unanswerable retort of a
majority in the division lobbies. But still, the speech of
Mr. Goschen on April 17th was an excellent one; it was
really the first, since the beginning of this debate, which
struck me as giving something to answer. Acute, subtle, a
dialectician to his finger-tips, Mr. Goschen is best as a critic,
and as a bit of criticism, his attack on the Bill was excellent.
Mr. Morley found himself compelled for the first time for
days to take serious notes; here at last were points which it
was necessary to confront. After all the dreary platitudes of
many days, this was a mercy for which to be thankful.</p>

<div class="sn">Randolph
dull.</div>

<p>Lord Randolph Churchill, rising on the following evening,
was not at his best. He has been passing through
what Disraeli once called a campaign of passion
in the provinces; and his speeches have been
full of the wildest fury. But all the fire had become extinguished.
When Lord Randolph Churchill makes up his
mind to be rational, few people in the House of Commons
can be more rational; but when he makes up his mind to
throw prudence, sense, and reserve to the winds, nobody can
rise to such heights and descend to such depths of wild, unreasonable,
bellowing Toryism&mdash;always, of course, excepting
Ashmead-Bartlett. But when he is rational he is often dull&mdash;when
he is unreasonable he is often very entertaining.
The speech of April 18th was a rational speech&mdash;it was,
therefore, a dull one. Lord Randolph is not what he was.
The voice which was formerly so resonant has become muffled
and sometimes almost indistinct, and the manner has lost
all the sprightliness which used to relieve it in the olden
days. The House of Commons is like the Revolution&mdash;it
often swallows its own children.</p>

<div class="sn">Father and
son.</div>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain might have been seen in two very
different characters in the course of that same
evening. He is not a soft man&mdash;amid sympathetic
sniggers from all the House, Mr. Morley at a later
stage referred sarcastically to the &quot;milk of human kindness&quot;
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" class="pagenum" title="Page 133"></a>
which flowed so copiously in his veins&mdash;but he is a man of
strong and warm domestic affections. He has the proud
privilege of having in the House of Commons not only a son,
but one who, in many respects, seems the very facsimile of
himself, for the likeness between Mr. Austen Chamberlain
and his father is startlingly close. This likeness is heightened
by the similarity of dress&mdash;by the single eyeglass that is worn
perennially in both cases, and, to a certain extent, by the walk.
When the son began to speak this Tuesday night, there was
even a stronger sense of the resemblance between the two.
The voice was almost the same, the gestures were the same&mdash;the
diction was not unlike&mdash;nearly all the tricks and mannerisms
of the elder man were reproduced by the younger. For
instance, when he is going to utter a good point, Mr. Chamberlain
makes a pause&mdash;the son does the same: when Mr.
Chamberlain is strongly moved, and wishes to drive home
some fierce thrust, there is a deep swell in his otherwise even
voice, and there is the same in the voice of the son. Then
there is the same crisp, terse succession of sentences&mdash;altogether
the likeness is wonderful.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Chamberlain
pleased.</div>

<p>It was pleasant, even to those who do not love Mr. Chamberlain
either personally or politically, to watch him
during this episode. When the son first stood up,
the pallor of the face, the unsteadiness of the
voice, the broken and stumbling accents, told of the high
state of nervous strain through which he was passing, and
it was easy to see that the emotions of the son had communicated
themselves to the father. Mr. Chamberlain had
his hat low down on his forehead so as to conceal his face
and its tell-tale excitement as much as possible. But it turned
out that he need not have been in the least alarmed. The
speech of young Mr. Chamberlain, for a maiden speech, was
really wonderful. It was lucid, well knit, pointed, cogent. Its
delivery was almost perfect; it had the true House of Commons
air and manner. This young man will go far. I shouldn't
be surprised if he became in time even a better debater than
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" class="pagenum" title="Page 134"></a>
his father. His education, I should say, is broader and
deeper, his mind finer, and his temper sweeter and more
under control. During the latter portion of the speech his
father's face had a smile, pleasant to behold; one could forgive
him a great deal of his hardness, rancour, even ferocity, for
this manifestation&mdash;open and frank&mdash;of kindly human-feeling.</p>

<div class="sn">And angry.</div>

<p>But, as I have said, there was another manifestation of
Mr. Chamberlain in the course of this very evening.
Shortly before ten o'clock Mr. Morley rose
to make his reply. It was twenty minutes to ten when he
rose. It was close upon midnight when he sate down. And
yet there wasn't one word too many&mdash;indeed, Mr. Morley
might have gone even longer without wearying the House,
for it was a speech which, although not free from some of
the besetting weaknesses of his oratory, was an eloquent, impressive
and convincing addition to the great argument
on the Irish question. Giving himself a certain freedom&mdash;departing
from the over-severe self-restraint which he so often
imposes upon himself&mdash;abandoning the frigidity of manner
which conceals from so many people his warmth of heart and
of temper, he spoke with a go, a fire and a force of attack
not very common with him. Above all things the speech
gave the impression of one who spoke from the inside&mdash;who
knew the subjects of which he was talking, not merely in
their general aspects, but in their dark recesses&mdash;in their
latent passion&mdash;in their awful and appalling depths. It was
while this fine speech was being delivered that the other and
the darker side of Mr. Chamberlain's nature was to be seen.
There are no such enmities as those between relatives or
former friends; and so it apparently is between Mr. Chamberlain
and Mr. Morley&mdash;though it should be said most of the
bitterness of the hatred seems to be on the one side. While
Mr. Morley is speaking there is a frown on the face of
Mr. Chamberlain that never lifts. Now and then, the sulky
and sullen and frowning silence was broken by an observation
evidently of bitter scornfulness addressed to Sir Henry James,
<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" class="pagenum" title="Page 135"></a>
and once there seemed even to be an angry interchange
between him and Mr. Courtney because Mr. Courtney had
ventured to put a civil question to Mr. Morley. Mr. Morley had
to address a few words of hearty congratulation to Mr. Austen
Chamberlain on his very successful speech. He spoke with
the slowness, hesitation, and effort that betrayed a certain
glimpse of the pain and grief that the political separations
of life produce in all but the hardest and coldest natures. It
was a graceful, generous, feeling tribute, but it did not soften
Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;the same steady unlifting frown was there&mdash;the
same &quot;puss&quot;&mdash;and when Mr. Morley had finished,
there was a repetition of the evidently scornful comment
of Mr. Chamberlain.</p>

<div class="sn">A hit at Mr.
Chamberlain.</div>

<p>But Mr. Morley may well bear all this, for he was able
to strike some very effective blows at Mr. Chamberlain,
and Mr. Chamberlain for a hard-hitter has
a wonderfully keen appreciation and a very
sensitive skin for anything like a dexterous hit at his own
expense. Alluding to the favourite argument of Mr. Chamberlain,
that the speeches of Irish members in the past may
have been deplorable, Mr. Morley asked were they the only
people who had made such speeches? They might be repentant
sinners, but who so great a prodigal as the member for
Birmingham? The loud and triumphant laughter which
this produced at the expense of Mr. Chamberlain, was followed
up by another even more victorious thrust. The Irish
members had abandoned prairie value in the same way as the
member for Birmingham had surrendered the doctrines of
&quot;ransom&quot; and natural rights. Mr. Chamberlain was very
uncomfortable, and soon showed it by an interrupting cheer.
&quot;Seriously,&quot; said Mr. Morley, passing from this lighter, but
very effective vein. And then he was interrupted by his foe.
&quot;Hear, hear,&quot; shouted Mr. Chamberlain in that deep, raucous,
fierce note, in which he reveals the fierceness of his hatred,
as though to say that it was time for Mr. Morley to address
himself to serious things.</p>

<div><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" class="pagenum" title="Page 136"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Mr. Sexton.</div>

<p>So the debate proceeded during the earlier part of the
week; as it neared its close it increased in
brilliancy, until in the last night it went out in a
blaze of splendour and glory. On the Thursday evening
Mr. Sexton was the speaker. He made a speech which was
two hours and a half in duration; it was in my opinion too
long&mdash;I think that except in the most exceptional cases no
orator ought to speak more than half an hour. And yet I
would not have had the speech shorter by one second; and
it is a singular proof of the extraordinary command which
this man holds over the House of Commons that he kept its
attention absolutely without a moment's pause or cessation,
during every bit of this tremendous strain upon his attention.
With the exception of Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Sexton is the one
man in the House who is capable of such a feat. This is
largely due not merely to his oratorical powers but to the
extraordinary range of his gifts. To the outside public&mdash;even
to the House of Commons&mdash;he is chiefly known by his great
rhetorical gifts; but this is only a part, and a small part, of
his great mental equipment. His mastery over figures in its
firmness of grasp, its lightning-like rapidity, its retentiveness,
is almost as great as that of a professional calculator. He
has a judgment, cold, equable, far-seeing, and he has a
humour that is kindly but can also be scorching, and that has
sometimes been deadly enough to leave wounds that never
healed.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Chamberlain's
arithmetic.</div>

<p>Perhaps not even Mr. Gladstone&mdash;certainly not Mr.
Goschen&mdash;though he, too, is a past master in
figures&mdash;is as formidable and destructive a
gladiator in a fight over figures as Mr. Sexton;
I pity any mortal who gets into grips with him on that arena.
Mr. Chamberlain was the unhappy individual whom Mr.
Sexton took in hand. Mr. Chamberlain has the reputation
of being a good man of business, he certainly was a most
successful one; and one would expect from him some power,
at least, of being able to state figures correctly. When the
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" class="pagenum" title="Page 137"></a>
figures he had presented to the country in a recent speech at
Birmingham came under analysis by Mr. Sexton, Mr.
Chamberlain was exposed as a bungler as stupid and dense
as one could imagine. Mr. Chamberlain's mighty fabric of
a war indemnity of millions which the financial arrangements
of this Bill would inflict on England, melted before Mr.
Sexton's examination&mdash;palpably, rapidly, exactly as though it
were a gaudy palace of snow which the midsummer sun was
melting into mere slush. The cocksureness of Mr. Chamberlain
makes his exposure a sort of comfort and delight to the
majority of the House; but still, the sense of his great powers&mdash;of
his commanding position as a debater&mdash;of his formidableness
as a political and Parliamentary enemy&mdash;made the
House almost unwilling to realize that he could be taken up
and reprimanded, and birched by anybody in the House with
the completeness with which Mr. Sexton was performing the
task. Mark you, there was nothing offensive&mdash;there was
nothing even severe in the language of Mr. Sexton's attack.
It was simply cold, pitiless, courteous but killing analysis&mdash;the
kind of analysis which the hapless and fraudulent bankrupt
has to endure when his castles in the air come to be
examined under the cold scrutiny of the Official Receiver in
the Bankruptcy Court.</p>

<div class="sn">Johnston of
Ballykilbeg.</div>

<p>A different tone was that which Mr. Sexton assumed to
Mr. Johnston of Ballykilbeg. Mr. Johnston,
known to the outer world as a fire-eater of the
most determined order, inside the House is one of
the most popular of men, and with no section of the House is
he more popular than with those Irish Nationalists for whose
blood he is supposed to thirst. With gentle and friendly wit
Mr. Sexton dealt with the case of Mr. Johnston lining the
ditch, declaring amid sympathetic laughter that the one object
of any Irish Nationalist who should meet the Orangemen in
such a position would be to take him out, even if he had to
carry him to do so. This reduction of the militancy of
Ulster down to the level of playful satire did much to relieve
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" class="pagenum" title="Page 138"></a>
the House from the tension which the wild language of
Ulsteria had been calculated to provoke. Finally, there came
a beautiful peroration&mdash;tender, touching, well sustained&mdash;which
was listened to with breathless attention by the House,
and produced as profound a depth of emotion on the Liberal
as even on the Irish Benches. It was a peroration which
lifted the great issue to all the heights of solemnity, nobility,
and supreme interest which it reaches in the mouth of an
eloquent orator. This tremendous speech&mdash;in its variety, in
its power&mdash;in its alternation of scathing scorn, copious
analysis, playful and gentle wit&mdash;was perhaps the most remarkable
example in our times of the sway which an orator
has over the House of Commons.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Carson.</div>

<p>Mr. Carson was unfortunate in every sense in having to
follow an oration of such extraordinary power,
and in having to follow it at that dread hour
when every member of the House of Commons is thinking of
his long-postponed dinner. The audience of &quot;the Sleuth
Hound of Coercion&quot;&mdash;as Mr. Carson is usually called&mdash;if it
was select, was at the same time, enthusiastic and appreciative.
The little band of Unionists, who get very cold comfort,
as a rule, during these hard times, sate steadily in their seats
and eagerly welcomed and warmly cheered Mr. Carson. Behind
him, too, was a pretty strong band of Tories, and Mr.
Balfour sate throughout his entire speech listening to it with
the keenest and most evident appreciation. I have already
described the appearance of Mr. Carson and the impression
he makes upon me; curiously enough, this impression was
confirmed by an experience that afternoon. I happened to
stand at a point of the House where I saw Mr. Carson from
profile as he was speaking. He had just got to the point
where, with a hoarse and deep note in his usually cold voice,
he said to Mr. Morley that if the Chief Secretary would move
the omission of all the &quot;safeguards&quot; from the Bill, he would
vote along with him. There was a tone almost of ferocity&mdash;the
tone which conveyed all the rage and despair of the Ascendency
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" class="pagenum" title="Page 139"></a>
party in Ireland at the prospect of departing power&mdash;the fury
of the Castle official that saw the approaching overthrow of
all the powerful citadel of fraud and cruelty and wrong, of
which he had been one of the chief pillars. And as Mr.
Carson was uttering these words, I saw his profile&mdash;which
often reveals more of men's natures than the front
face.</p>

<div class="sn">A curious
reminiscence.</div>

<p>I suppose I shall be considered very fantastic&mdash;but do you
know what I thought of at that very moment?
Some years ago, I stood at Epsom close to the
ropes and saw Fred Archer pass me as he swept
like the whirlwind to the winning-post in the last Derby he
ever rode. Between Mr. Carson and Mr. Fred Archer,
especially in the profile, there is a certain and even a close
resemblance; the same long lantern face, the same sunken
cheeks, the same prominent mouth, the same skin dark as
the gipsy's. Never shall I forget the look on Fred Archer's
face at the moment when I saw it&mdash;it was but for a second&mdash;and
yet the impression dwells ineffaceable upon my memory
and imagination. There was a curious mixture of terror,
resolve, hope, despair on the sunken cheeks that was almost
appalling&mdash;that look represented, embodied, summed up, as
though in some sudden glimpse of another and a nether
world, all the terrible and awful passions that stormed at the
hearts of thousands in the great gambling panorama all
around. And there was something of the same look on the
profile of Mr. Carson&mdash;I could almost have pitied him and
the party and traditions and past which he represented as
I saw its death-throes marked on his suffering and fierce
face.</p>

<p>But the speech of Mr. Carson was a clever one. Whatever
the inner eye may see in the depths of Mr. Carson's soul, to
the outward eye he has an appearance of a self-possession
amounting almost to the offensive. He is dressed almost as
well as Mr. Austen Chamberlain, but, unlike Mr. Chamberlain's
promising lad&mdash;who still has much of the graceful
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" class="pagenum" title="Page 140"></a>
shyness and unsteady nerve of youth&mdash;Mr. Carson has all the
coolness, self-assertion, and hardness of the man who has
passed through the fierce and tempestuous conflicts of Irish
life. Mr. Carson stands at the box and leans upon it as
though he had been there all his life; he shoots his cuffs&mdash;to
use a House of Commons' phrase&mdash;as dexterously and almost
as frequently as Mr. Gladstone; his points are stated slowly,
deliberately, with that wary and watchful look of the man
who has been accustomed to utter the words that consigned
men to the horrors of Tullamore. The speech of Thursday
evening was a clever speech. It wasn't broad&mdash;it wasn't
generous&mdash;there was not a note in it above the tone of the
Crown Prosecutor, but it was subtle, well-reasoned&mdash;the
blows were happy, and told&mdash;and the Tories and Unionists
were hugely and justly delighted.</p>

<div class="sn">The approach
of the division.</div>

<p>At last we are within sight of the end. Friday had come,
and everybody knew that this was the day which
would see the division; and, after all, the division
was the event of the debate. In moments such
as these you can hear the quickened throb of the House of
Commons, and if you fail to notice it you soon learn it from
the public. In the lobbies outside stand scores of excited
men and women begging, imploring, threatening&mdash;using
every means to get admission into the galleries to witness a
historic and immortal scene. Outside there is an even denser
crowd&mdash;ready to hoot or cheer their favourites. The galleries
are all crowded; peers stand on each other's toes, and
patiently wait for hours. About ten o'clock a man rushes
into the lobby, and there is a movement that looks most like
a scare&mdash;as though the messenger were some herald of
disaster. In a few minutes you see a great stir and a curious
suppressed excitement in the lobby, and then you observe
that the Prince of Wales has come down to pay the House
one of his rare visitations, and to take that place above
the clock which it is his privilege on these occasions to
occupy.</p>

<div><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" class="pagenum" title="Page 141"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Sir Henry James.</div>

<p>The evening began with a speech of Sir Henry James
for the Unionist party&mdash;legal and dry as dust,
but, towards the end, reaching a height&mdash;or shall
I say a depth&mdash;of fierce party passion. In language
more veiled, more deliberate, but as intelligible as
Mr. Balfour's and Lord Randolph Churchill's, the ex-Attorney-General
called upon the Orangemen to rise in
rebellion. And, working himself up gradually from the slow
and funereal tones which he usually employs, Sir Henry
James wound up with a fierce, rude, savage gibe at Mr.
Gladstone. Almost shouting out the word, &quot;Betrayed!&quot;
he pointed a threatening and scornful finger at the head of
Mr. Gladstone, and the Tories and Unionists frantically
cheered.</p>

<p>It was more than ten o'clock when Mr. Balfour rose.
The assembly was brilliant in its density, its character, its
pent-up emotion, and in many respects the speech was worthy
of the occasion. He was wise enough not to entangle
himself in the inextricable network of clauses and sub-sections.
In broad, general lines he assailed the policy of
the Bill and of the Government, and now and then worked
up his party to almost frenzied excitement. The cheers of
the Tories were taken up by the Unionists, who thronged
their benches with unusual density of attendance. Now
and then there were fierce protests from the Irish Benches;
but, on the whole, they were patient, self-restrained, and
silent.</p>

<div class="sn">Gladstone.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, meantime, was down early, after but a
short stay for dinner. His face had that rapt
look of reverie which it wears on all these solemn
and great occasions, and there was a slightly deadlier pallor
on the cheek. Mr. Balfour persisted with his speech to the
bitter end, and now and then Mr. Gladstone gave an
impatient and anxious look at the clock. The hands pointed
to ten minutes to midnight before this man of eighty-three
was on his legs to address a crowded, hot, jaded assembly in
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" class="pagenum" title="Page 142"></a>
a speech that would wind up one of the great stages in the
greatest controversy of his life.</p>

<div class="sn">The opening.</div>

<p>We who love and follow him hold our breaths, and
our nervous anxiety rises almost to terror.
Can he stand the strain?&mdash;will he break down
from sheer physical fatigue and the exhaustion of long
waiting? The first few notes of the deep voice are reassuring.
The opening sentences also have that full roll
which nearly always is inevitable proof that the great
swelling opening will carry him on to the end; and yet there
is anxiety. Those who know him well cannot help observing
that there is just a slight trace of excitement, nervousness,
and anxiety in the voice and manner. He has evidently been
put out by the lateness of the hour to which the speech has
been postponed. There is beside him a vast mass of notes,
and then, before he reaches that, there is the long speech to
which he has just listened, many points of which it is
impossible to leave unnoticed. And so the first ten minutes
strike me as rather poor&mdash;poor, I mean, for Mr. Gladstone&mdash;and
my heart sinks. In memory I go back to that
memorable and unforgettable speech on that terrible night
in 1886, when, with dark and disastrous defeat prepared for
him in the lobbies the moment he sat down, Mr. Gladstone
delivered a speech, the echoes of whose beautiful tones&mdash;immortal
and ineffaceable&mdash;still linger in the ear. And now
the moment of Nemesis and triumph has come, and is he
going to fall below the level of the great hour?</p>

<p>Ah! these fears are all vain. The exquisite cadence&mdash;the
delightful bye-play&mdash;the broad, free gesture&mdash;the lofty
tones of indignation and appeal&mdash;but, above all, the even
tenderness, composure, and charity that endureth all things&mdash;all
these qualities range through this magnificent speech.
Thus he wishes to administer to Sir Henry James a well-merited
rebuke for his terrible and flagitious incitements, and,
with uplifted hands, and in a voice of infinite scorn, Mr.
Gladstone turns on Sir Henry, and overwhelms him,
<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" class="pagenum" title="Page 143"></a>
amid a tempest of cheers from the delighted Irishry and
Liberals.</p>

<div class="sn">Chamberlain
touched.</div>

<p>But there is another and an even more extraordinary
instance of the power, grace, and mastery of the
mighty orator. The G.O.M. had made an allusion
to that pleasant and promising speech of young
Austen Chamberlain, of which I have spoken already. Just
by the way, with that delightful and unapproachable lightness
of touch which is the unattainable charm of Mr. Gladstone's
oratory, he alluded to the speech and to Mr. Chamberlain
himself. &quot;I will not enter into any elaborate eulogy of that
speech,&quot; said Mr. Gladstone. &quot;I will endeavour to sum up
my opinion of it by simply saying that it was a speech which
must have been dear and refreshing to a father's heart.&quot;
And then came one of the most really pathetic scenes I have
ever beheld in the House of Commons&mdash;a scene with that
touch of nature which makes the whole akin, and, for the
moment, brings the fiercest personal and political foes into
the holy bond of common human feeling. Mr. Chamberlain
is completely unnerved&mdash;I should have almost said for the
first time in his life. I have seen this very remarkable man
under all kinds of circumstances&mdash;in triumph&mdash;in disaster&mdash;in
rage&mdash;in composure&mdash;but never before&mdash;not even in
the very ecstasy of the hours of party feeling&mdash;never before
did I see him lose for a moment his self-possession. First,
he bowed low to Mr. Gladstone in gratitude&mdash;and then the
tears sprang to his eyes; his lips trembled painfully, and his
hand sprang to his forehead, as though to hide the woman's
tears that did honour to his manhood. And, curiously
enough, the feeling did not pass away. I know not whether
Mr. Chamberlain was out of sorts on this great night; but
his manner was very different on this night of nights;
indeed, from what it has been at every other period of this
fierce, stormy Session. He cheered as loudly and as frequently
as the best of the rank and file&mdash;interrupted&mdash;in
short, manifested all the passions of the hour. But on that
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" class="pagenum" title="Page 144"></a>
Friday night&mdash;specially after this allusion of Mr. Gladstone's
to his son&mdash;he sate silent, and in a far-off reverie.</p>

<p>But the Old Man still passes on his triumphant way&mdash;now
gently, now stormy&mdash;listened to in delight from all
parts; and when he is now and then interrupted by some
small and rude Tory, dismissing the interruption with delightful
composure and a good humour that nothing can
disturb. It is only the marvellous powers of the man that
can keep the House patient, for it is pointing to one o'clock,
and the division has not yet come. But at last he is
approaching the peroration. It has the glad note of coming
triumph&mdash;subdued, however, to the gentle tone of good taste.
It is delivered, like the whole of the speech, with extraordinary
nerve, and without any abatement of the fire, the
vehemence, the sweeping rapidity of the best days. And it
ends in notes, clear, resonant&mdash;almost like a peal of
joy-bells.</p>

<div class="sn">The division.</div>

<p>Then there are the shouts of &quot;Aye&quot; and &quot;No,&quot; with
&quot;Agreed, agreed!&quot; from some Irish Benches&mdash;a
humorous suggestion that highly tickles everybody.
Mr. Gladstone is almost the last to enter from the
lobby of the majority. Alone, slowly, with pale face, he
walks up the floor. The significance of the great moment,
the long years of struggle, of heroic courage, of inflexible
temerity, of patient and splendid hope, all this rushes
tumultuously to the minds of his friends and followers, and,
in a second, without a word of warning or command, the
Liberals and the Irish have sprung to their feet, and,
underneath their cheers&mdash;their waving hats, their uplifted
forms&mdash;Mr. Gladstone passes through to his seat as under a
canopy.</p>

<p>At last, Tom Ellis, the Junior Liberal Whip, quickly
comes up the floor&mdash;the paper is handed to Mr. Marjoribanks&mdash;this
announces we have won&mdash;a good cheer, but short,
for we want to know the numbers&mdash;and then they are
read out.</p>

<div><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" class="pagenum" title="Page 145"></a></div>

<p>The majority is 43. The Lord be praised! we have
polled all our men! And then more cheers&mdash;taken up
outside in the deeper bellow of the big crowd, and then more
waving of hats and another great reception to Mr. Gladstone.
And so, as the streaks of day rose on this hour of Ireland's
coming dawn, we went to our several homes.</p>

<h3>THE BUDGET, OBSTRUCTION, AND EGYPT.</h3>


<div class="sn">Sir William.</div>

<p>Sir William Harcourt, on April 24th, had the double honour
of speaking before the smallest audience and
making the best Budget speech for many years.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has two manners. He
can be as boisterous, exuberant, and gay, as any speaker in
the House, and he can also be as lugubrious as though his
life had been spent in the service of an undertaker. He was
in the undertaker mood this evening. Slowly, solemnly,
sadly, he unfolded his story of the finances of the country.
He had taken the trouble to write down every word of what
he had to say&mdash;an evil habit to which he has adhered all his
life. But, notwithstanding these two things&mdash;which are both,
to my mind, capital defects in Parliamentary speaking&mdash;Sir
William put his case with such extraordinary lucidity, that
everybody listened in profound attention to every word he
uttered; and when he sate down, he was almost overwhelmed
with the chorus of praise which descended on his head from
all quarters of the House.</p>

<p>Sir William Harcourt imitated most Chancellors of the
Exchequer, in keeping his secret to the latest possible moment.
Like a good dramatist also, he arranged his figures and the
matter of his speech so well that the final solution became
inevitable, and the final solution, of course, was the
addition of a penny to the income-tax. The debate which
followed the Budget speech was quiet, discursive, friendly
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147" class="pagenum" title="Page 147"></a>
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Mr. Picton is a formidable
man to Chancellors of the Exchequer&mdash;for he has very
strong ideas of reform&mdash;especially on the breakfast-table;
but Mr. Picton is rational as well as Radical; and he cordially
acknowledged the duty of postponing even the reforms on
which Radicals have set their hearts until more convenient
times and seasons.</p>

<div class="sn">Belfast.</div>

<p>It was after midnight when a very serious bit of business
took place. The House gets to know beforehand
when anything like serious debate is going to
take place&mdash;even though there be no notice. Accordingly,
in spite of the lateness of the hour, the House was pretty
full, and there was a preliminary air of expectation and
excitement. One of the iron rules of the House of Commons
is that the Speaker cannot leave the chair until a motion for
the adjournment of the House has been carried. This is
always proposed by the senior Government Whip. The
motion is usually carried in dumb show, and with that mumble
in which business is carried through in the House when
there is no opposition. But it is one of the ancient and
time-honoured privileges of the House of Commons to raise
almost any question on the motion for the adjournment of
the House. The reason, I assume, is that the representatives
of the people&mdash;when about to separate&mdash;thought in the olden
days that it ought to be their right to raise any question whatsoever,
lest the king in their absence should take advantage of
the situation. Many of the rules of the House&mdash;including
several which lend themselves to obstruction&mdash;are due to this
feeling of constant vigilance and suspicion towards the Crown.</p>

<p>Mr. Sexton is one of the men whose life is centred in
the House of Commons. He will attend to no other business,
except under the direst pressure&mdash;he has no other interests&mdash;though
he used to be one of the greatest of readers, and
still can quote Shakespeare and other masterpieces of English
literature better than any man in the House except Mr.
Justin McCarthy. Thus, when he rose after midnight, he
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" class="pagenum" title="Page 148"></a>
had in his notes before him a perfectly tabulated account
of the riots in Belfast, so that every single fact was present
to his mind. The story he had to tell is already known&mdash;the
attacks on Catholic workmen&mdash;on Catholic boys&mdash;on Catholic
girls&mdash;by the sturdy defenders of law, loyalty, and order in
Belfast. It was not an occasion for strong speech&mdash;the facts
spoke with their silent eloquence better than any tongue
could do. The business was all done very quietly&mdash;it had
the sombre reticence of all tragic crises; everybody felt the
importance of the affair too deeply to give way to strong
manifestation of feeling. But there were significant and
profound, though subdued, marks of feeling on the Liberal
Benches; and everybody could see what names were in the
minds of everybody.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Asquith
as leader.</div>

<p>Mr. Asquith was for the moment the leader of the House.
Though he has still some of the ingenuous shyness
of youth&mdash;though he is modest with all
his honours&mdash;though he has charmed everybody
by the utter absence of swagger and side in his dazzling
elevation&mdash;there is a ready adaptability about Mr. Asquith
to a Parliamentary situation, which is as astonishing as it is
rare in men who have spent their lives in the atmosphere of
the law courts. The aptitude with which the right word
always comes to his lips&mdash;his magnificent composure, and, at
the same time, his power of striking the nail right on the
head and right <i>into</i> the head&mdash;all these things come out on
an occasion such as that of April 24th. Very quietly, but
very significantly, he told the story of the riots; and very
quietly and very significantly he spoke of the responsibility of
the Salisburys, and the Balfours, and the Jameses, whose wild
and wicked words had led to this outburst of medieval bigotry.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Dunbar
Barton.</div>

<p>Mr. Dunbar Barton made a valiant but vain attempt to
stem the tide against him, but he, like every
other Unionist, was weighted down by the
feeling that the Orangemen were doing immense
service to the cause of Home Rule by their brutality.
How<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" class="pagenum" title="Page 149"></a>ever,
the fumes of Unionist oratory seem to have ascended
to the heads of all the excitable young men of the Tory
party. Mr. Dunbar Barton, personally, is one of the gentlest
of men; his manners are kind and good-natured enough to
make him a universal favourite&mdash;even with his vehement
Nationalist foes; and he speaks with evident sincerity. But
he had so worked himself up that he babbled blithely of
spending a portion of his days in penal servitude&mdash;talked
big about a mysterious organization which was being got
ready in Ulster, and declared that the day would come when
he would stand by the side of the Orangemen in the streets
of Belfast. He was listened to for the most part in silence,
until he tripped into an unseemly remark about Mr. Gladstone,
when the much-tried Liberals burst into an angry
protest.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Arnold Forster.</div>

<p>Very different was Mr. Arnold Forster. I must be
pardoned if, as an Irishman, I always see something
genial and not wholly unlovely even in the
most violent Irish enemy. We all like Johnston
of Ballykilbeg&mdash;most of us rather like Colonel Saunderson,
and Mr. Dunbar Barton is decidedly popular. But this
Arnold Forster&mdash;with his dry, self-complacent, self-sufficient
fanaticism&mdash;is intolerable and hateful. He never gets up
without making one angry. There is no man whose genius
would entitle him to half the arrogant self-conceit of this
young member. Acrid, venomous, rasping, he injures his own
cause by the very excess of his gall and by the exuberance of
his pretension. He also saw that the riots would do no good,
and he hinted darkly of what he called &quot;ordered resistance,&quot;
whatever that means. But, on the whole, the advocates of
the Orangemen made a very poor show.</p>

<div class="sn">Tory
obstruction.</div>

<p>The Tories thus early developed the policy of preventing
the Government passing any Bill&mdash;English or
Irish&mdash;good or bad. Whenever a good English
Bill stood as the first order&mdash;a Bill which they
did not dare to oppose&mdash;they found some excuse for moving
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" class="pagenum" title="Page 150"></a>
the adjournment of the House. This is a privilege which
was intended to be used very rarely, but in the course of the
present Session it has been very freely resorted to&mdash;especially
when it has afforded a chance of keeping off good Government
business. On Tuesday, April 25th, the excuse given was
that Mr. Bryce had been guilty of political partisanship in
adding a batch of Liberals to the Bench in Lancashire over
the head of Lord Sefton&mdash;the Tory or Unionist Lord-Lieutenant
of the county. Mr. Legh, a young, silent, and retiring
Tory member, began the attack, and did so in a very neat,
well-worded, and pretty little speech. Mr. Hanbury&mdash;who is
making his fame as a champion obstructive&mdash;followed this
up, and Mr. Curzon addressed the House in his superior style.
Mr. Bryce was able to blow to pieces the fabric of attack
which had been so laboriously erected against him by stating
a few facts, of which these may be given as a fair specimen.
When Mr. Bryce came into office, of the borough magistrates
in Lancashire 507 were Unionists and only 159 were Liberals.
On the county bench there were 522 Unionists and 142
Liberals. This was a crushing reply, and an even more
satisfactory retort came in the shape of the division, when 260
voted for the Government, and only 186 against.</p>

<div class="sn">Tommy
&quot;Burt.&quot;</div>

<p>Nearly three hours of precious public time had been
wasted over this wretched business, and at last,
for the third or fourth time, the debate was
resumed on the second reading of the Employers'
Liability Bill. An amendment of Mr. Chamberlain's had
been the obstacle which stood in the way of the Bill all this
time. After the debate had gone on for hours, Mr. Chamberlain
got up and declared that his amendment had served its
purpose&mdash;an awkward way of putting it, which the Liberals
were not slow to take up. The debate was made remarkable
by the first speech of any importance made by Mr. Burt since
he became a member of the Ministry. Mr. Burt is the most
popular of members, and there was a ring of genuine delight
in the welcome given to the honest, modest, genuine working
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" class="pagenum" title="Page 151"></a>
man standing at the Treasury Bench, and symbolising the
revolution of the times. Mr. Burt spoke ably and well, but
it was in a foreign tongue&mdash;which it takes a little time for even
a quick linguist to understand. This Northumbrian burr is
the strongest accent in the House; even the broadest Scotch
is less difficult to catch. It is curious how the different parts
of the country betray themselves by their speech. There are
Scotchmen whom it is not easy to follow, and there are very
few of them who speak with anything like an English accent.
Even the most fluent of the Welshmen speak with a certain
hesitation, betraying their bilingual infancy and youth. The
Irish have as many accents nearly as there are members. The
Northumbrian burr, however, is a tongue apart. It has the
pleasantness of every foreign tongue, and since Mr. Joseph
Cowen left Parliamentary life, Mr. Burt is the only member
who speaks it in its pristine purity. The Tories were closured
finally, though they had their revenge by preventing the Bill
from going to the Grand Committee, and the work of justice
is a little longer postponed.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Goschen
playful.</div>

<p>On Thursday, April 27th, the debate began on Sir
William Harcourt's Budget; and it found Mr.
Goschen in an
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;unusally&quot; in the original text">unusually</ins>
playful mood. He had
a task for which his talents eminently fitted him.
Irresolute, timid, changeable, he is the very worst man in the
world for constructive legislation; but give him the opportunity
of criticising what somebody else has proposed, and
he is in his real element, and is, perhaps, the very best man
in the House of Commons. There wasn't much to criticise
in the Budget of Sir William Harcourt from the Tory point
of view. Finding himself with a deficit the Liberal leader
was unable to go in for any startling novelty, especially in a
Session when everything is to be opposed in order that Home
Rule may be defeated. But one would have thought that
this would have delighted the timid and conservative soul of
Mr. Goschen. Not a bit of it. Taking cleverly the rather
auroral promises of the election period, Mr. Goschen
con<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" class="pagenum" title="Page 152"></a>trasted
all these hopes and glowing prospects with the thin
and meagre fare of Sir William's Budget. It was very well
done&mdash;full of unwonted fire, of biting and effective raillery
and of excellent party hits; it lit up for a brief space the
sombreness which has fallen so completely on the Tory
Benches in this year of wails and lamentations.</p>

<div class="sn">Sir William
as an early
Christian.</div>

<p>But the debate soon relapsed under a soporific speech from
Sir John Lubbock, who made an insinuating proposal
to open a discussion on Home Rule in the
midst of the debate on the Imperial Budget. Sir
William was a delight during these proceedings. Everybody
knows that he has both a warm heart and a warm temper,
and there have been times when the collisions between himself
and Mr. Goschen have seemed to indicate a violence of
personal as well as of party antagonism. But the duty of
great ministers is to practise the scriptural principle of turning
the other cheek to the smiter. It is wonderful, indeed, to
see how humanity can attune itself to a situation. The most
violent and vehement free-lance below the gangway sobers
down in office to politeness, and peace with all men of good
or bad will. Sir William, sitting on the Treasury Bench
that night&mdash;beneath the wild tirade of Mr. Goschen&mdash;under
the dreary drip of Sir John Lubbock&mdash;was a sight that a new
Addison might show to his child; not that he might see how
a Christian might die, but how a great Christian official could
suffer with all the patience of silent and suffering merit.
There was a look of almost dazzling and beatific sanctity on
Sir William's face that was perfectly delightful to behold.
And when he got up to reply to Mr. Goschen and to Sir John
Lubbock, whither had departed that splendid rotundity of
voice&mdash;that resonant shout of triumph or of defiance? Sir
William coo'd gently as the white-feathered dove; and the
Tory Benches, which had been ebullient with excitement a
few moments before, could not find it in their hearts to do
other than listen reverently to this good and holy man
expostulating with heathen foes. And thus the first
reso<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" class="pagenum" title="Page 153"></a>lution
of the Budget got quietly through, which was exactly
what the Chancellor of the Exchequer wanted; whereupon
there might have been observed, perhaps, by a close looker-on,
a sinking of one of Sir William's eyelids, which might
have suggested in a lesser mortal the wink of the man who takes
off the mask when the comedy is over. Sir William is
a splendid artiste.</p>

<div class="sn">A great night.</div>

<p>It was probably under the influence of Sir William that
this turned out to be the greatest and best night
the Government had had so far. The Railway
Servants' Bill got through its third reading amid cheers, and
then, before it knew where it was, the House found itself
actually in the same night discussing a third Ministerial
measure&mdash;the Scotch Fisheries Bill. It is one of the
privileges of Scotland that nobody takes the least interest in
her measures outside her own representatives, and that even
they are sombre and joyless in the expression of their delight.
The demand for Scotch Home Rule does not come assuredly
from the intervention of English or Irish speech. I have never
seen the House with more than a score or two of members
when a Scotch question is under discussion, and on the rare
occasions on which a Southron does dare to intrude upon the
sacred domain, it is with the most shamefaced looks. And
so Sir George Trevelyan and his Scotch friends were allowed
to have their nice little tea-party without any interruption,
and the Bill got very nicely through. Thus ended a remarkable
night.</p>

<div class="sn">The bullet
in Downing
Street.</div>

<p>And now I come to the point which, after all, had been
the most interesting during the week, and which,
though rarely mentioned, was in everybody's
mind. It was on the Thursday evening that
Mr. Sexton got up quietly to ask whether the reports published
in the evening papers were true, that a man had been
arrested the previous night in Downing Street, who had
apparently intended to attempt the assassination of the Prime
Minister. There was death-like stillness all over the House
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" class="pagenum" title="Page 154"></a>
as Mr. Sexton put his question&mdash;picking his words slowly
and deliberately. If men were not so anxious and so shocked
there might have been some demonstration of the vehement
anger which was felt in so many breasts as Mr. Sexton brought
out the words which put in collocation in the mind of the
unfortunate lunatic the idea of attempting to kill Mr. Gladstone,
and the phrase of Sir Henry James during the debate
on the Home Rule Bill. But feeling was too intense and
solemn for outspoken or loud utterance, and Mr. Sexton was
allowed to put his question to the end without any interruption
from the intensely excited and profoundly thrilled
assembly. This is one of the curiosities of Parliamentary
and British nature&mdash;that the moments of tensest feeling are
so often those which, to a stranger, would appear listless,
indifferent, impassive. Mr. Asquith spoke in tones suitable
to the temper of the assembly. This was a very grave
matter, he said; but it was for the moment before the courts
of law, and his lips were sealed. And so the subject
dropped.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr.
Gladstone.</div>

<p>The people were asking themselves what would happen,
when Mr. Gladstone entered the House; but if
there had been any desire to mark the occasion,
he himself prevented it. He dropped more
quietly into his seat than usual, and at the moment when,
to a thin House, Sir William was giving one of those
gentle and beatific answers to which I have already alluded.
To judge by Mr. Gladstone's quietness of entrance, nothing
unusual had happened to him, and he himself had
declined even to talk about the matter. And yet there was
a certain look as of reverie on his face&mdash;as though of a man
who had looked into that dark and hideous abyss called
Death. He had not been looking very well for some days,
and perhaps there was not&mdash;though imagination saw it&mdash;a
deadlier pallor than usual on the face. But it was only
when he was sitting on the deserted bench beside Sir William
Harcourt that one had an opportunity of detecting any
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" class="pagenum" title="Page 155"></a>
difference between his usual appearance and his appearance
at that particular moment. The minute he had any part to
take in the proceedings of the House, he was just as alert,
cheerful, self-composed as ever. This wonderful man is as
much a miracle physically as mentally. The giant intellect
is backed by a steady nerve, the perfect mind by the perfect
body. And thus he is able to go through trials, dangers,
fatigues, which would destroy any ordinary man, as though
nothing had occurred. During this week, indeed, he was
especially playful. On the Tuesday night, when the onslaught
was being made on Mr. Bryce, Sir Henry James
spoke of Lord Sefton as being a strong Liberal. Mr.
Gladstone uttered a quiet, gentle, deprecatory &quot;Oh!&quot;
whereupon Sir Henry James reiterated his statement with a
look of surprise and shock. Mr. Gladstone didn't depart
from his attitude of gentle and almost plaintive remonstrance.
He waved his hand mildly, and with a smile, and
Sir Henry James was allowed to proceed to the solemn end
of his solemn harangue.</p>

<div class="sn">A visit to the
Lords.</div>

<p>It is not often that a rational man takes the trouble of
paying a visit to the House of Lords. But that
assembly was certainly worth a visit on
May 1st. When the fight in Woodford, County
Galway, was at its height, and everybody was repeating the
name of Lord Clanricarde, people began to ask if there
were ever such a person, or if he were not merely the creation
of some morbid imagination&mdash;desirous of conjuring up a
human bogey for the purpose of demonstrating the iniquities
of Irish landlordism. The story on the estate which he
owned, and whose destinies he controlled, was that, on one
occasion, a strange spectral figure had been seen following
the coffin of the old Clanricarde to the tomb of his fathers;
that the figure had disappeared as suddenly and as noiselessly
as it had come; that it had not reappeared even on the
solemn occasion when again the historic and century-old
vaults of the family graveyard had opened to receive the
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" class="pagenum" title="Page 156"></a>
late lord's wife and the existing lord's mother. Writing his
missives from afar&mdash;invisible, unapproachable, unknown&mdash;
or known, rather, only by harsh refusal&mdash;by dogged, obdurate
rejection of all terms&mdash;save the full pound of flesh&mdash;not even
rendered human by passionate and eloquent outburst of
remonstrance, but represented by thin, brief, business-like
and curt notes as of a very crusty solicitor&mdash;such Lord
Clanricarde appeared to the imaginations of the people of
the district of which he was almost the supreme master.
There were riots&mdash;fierce conflicts extending over days&mdash;then
dreary sentences of lengthy imprisonments, with gaol
tragedies; but still this strange, dry, inarticulate, obstinate
figure remained immutable, always invisible, unapproachable,
obdurate, spectral. Even the Tory leaders were
disgusted and wearied, and Mr. Balfour was careful, in the
very crisis and agony of his fight with the National League,
to disavow all sympathy with the strange being that was
bringing to his assistance all the mighty resources of an
Empire's army, an Empire's exchequer, and an Empire's
overwhelming power to crush in blood, in the silence of the
cell and the deeper silence of the tomb, all resistance
to his imperious will.</p>

<div class="sn">Entry of
a ghost.</div>

<p>It must have been with something of a shock that the
House of Lords, with all its well-trained and
high-bred self-control, found that this curious
and fateful figure was within its gates. Probably,
to scarcely half-a-dozen of his colleagues and fellow-peers,
was this figure anything but a strange and unexpected
incursion from the dim ghost-land, in which, hermit-like,
he seems to dwell. Indeed, the Marquis of Londonderry
was careful to explain that he had no personal acquaintance
with the man whose case he was defending against the action
of the Commission presided over by Mr. Justice Mathew.
And it was easy to see, that Lord Clanricarde was a stranger,
and a very lonely one, too, in that assembly in which he is
entitled to sit and vote on the nation's destinies. On a back
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" class="pagenum" title="Page 157"></a>
seat, on the Liberal side of the House, silent, forlorn, unspeaking
and unspoken to, he sat throughout the long and
tedious debate in which he was a protagonist. There was,
indeed, something shocking to the sense&mdash;shocking in being
so surprising&mdash;that this should be the figure around which
one of the fiercest and most tragic political struggles of our
time should have surged. He is a man slightly above the
middle height, thin in face and in figure. Somehow or other,
there is a general air about him that I can only describe by
the word shabby&mdash;I had almost ventured on the term ragged.
The clothes hang somewhat loosely&mdash;are of a pattern that
recalls a half century ago&mdash;and have all the air of having
been worn until they are positively threadbare. Altogether,
there is about this inheritor of a great name&mdash;of vast
estates&mdash;of a title that in its days was almost kingly&mdash;an
air that suggests a combination between the recluse and the
poor man of letters, who makes his home in the reading-room
of the British Museum. It was also a peculiarity of
the position that he seemed an almost unwelcome visitant,
even to those who had to defend him. There was an awful
pause when he rose, silently and so spectre-like, from his
seat in the dim land of the back benches, and passed to the
seat immediately behind the Marquis of Salisbury. Lord
Salisbury made a very vivid and amusing speech in the
course of the evening, in defence of Lord Clanricarde and
in an attack on Mr. Justice Mathew; but observers thought
they saw a look of palpable discomfort pass across his face
at the approach of the Marquis of Clanricarde. The Lord
of Woodford handed to Lord Salisbury a little bundle of
papers; in the distance, the bundle had an inexpressibly
shabby look&mdash;the look one might expect on the bundle which
some Miss Flit of the Legislature would bring every day, as
the record of her undetermined claim. Altogether, this
appearance of Lord Clanricarde in the glimpses of the moon,
rather added to the mysterious atmosphere in which he
loves to live.</p>

<div><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" class="pagenum" title="Page 158"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Sir Charles
Dilke.</div>

<p>In the meantime, a very interesting debate was going on
in the House of Commons. I have already
remarked that Sir Charles Dilke has, in an
extremely short time, re-established that mastery
over the ear and the mind of the House of Commons which
he used to exercise with such extraordinary power in the old
days before misfortune overcame him. It is a power and
mastery derived from a perfect House of Commons mind.
Sir Charles Dilke, doubtless, has written on many subjects
outside mere politics; but in politics his whole heart and
soul are concentrated. There is no man in the House of
Commons so thoroughly political. It would be bewildering
to give even the heads of the subjects on which he has
written and in which he is profoundly learned. He has
written about our Army&mdash;he could tell you everything about
every army corps in the German Army&mdash;he knows all about
every fortress on the French frontier&mdash;he can convey to you
a photographic picture of every great public man on the
Continent&mdash;he would be able in the morning to take charge
of the Admiralty, and over and on top of all this knowledge
he could tell you every detail of the law of registration, of
parochial rating, of vestry work, and all the rest of that
curious technical, dry, detailed information which raises the
ire of parish souls, and forms the fierce conflicts of suburban
ratepayers.</p>

<div class="sn">Egypt.</div>

<p>It could be seen after he had been five minutes on his
legs that Sir Charles Dilke was about to give on
Egypt a speech which would suggest this sense
of easy and complete mastery of all the facts, and that,
therefore, the speech would be a thorough success. And so
it was&mdash;so successful, indeed, that it was listened to with
equal attention by the Tories as by the Liberals, though
nothing could be more abhorrent to the Tory imagination than
the proposal by Sir Charles Dilke of an early evacuation of
Egypt. Perhaps their indignation was a little mitigated by
the fact which Sir Charles Dilke brought out with such
clear<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" class="pagenum" title="Page 159"></a>ness,
that Lord Salisbury was just as deeply committed
to the eventual evacuation of Egypt as any other public
man.</p>

<div class="sn">An awkward
situation.</div>

<p>It was curious to watch the House of Commons during
this debate. There is no doubt that a very
awkward situation was before that assembly.
On the one hand, there were the interests of the
country&mdash;as they are understood by the Tory party; on the
other, there was a very difficult party situation&mdash;a situation
difficult enough to tempt even the most patriotic, self-denying,
and impartial Tory to gaze on the Liberal leaders
opposite with a certain amount of mischievous curiosity.
How was Mr. Gladstone going to make a speech which would
fulfil those extremely diverse purposes? First, leave the door
open for a continued stay for some time longer, and at the
same moment for final evacuation; secondly, please Sir Wm.
Harcourt on the one side, and Lord Rosebery on the other;
thirdly, keep together a party which ranges from the strong
foreign policy of moderate men to the ultra-nonintervention
of Mr. Labouchere. Mr. Gladstone had, however, to do a
good deal more than this. For it was easy to see from the
condition of the Tory seats, and especially from the attitude
of the front Opposition Bench, that party instinct had suggested
that this was just one of the occasions on which the
Government might be put in a very tight place. Let Mr.
Gladstone say something which would satisfy Mr. Labouchere,
and immediately Mr. Goschen would be down upon him&mdash;the
late Chancellor of the Exchequer had the air of a man who was
thoroughly primed for damaging criticism and ardent attack&mdash;with
a philippic charging him with abandoning the most
sacred interests of the country. Indeed, it was quite evident
that Mr. Gladstone had to face a very ugly little question,
and that his political foes had come down in full
force to enjoy the spectacle of a Christian flung to the
lions.</p>

<div class="sn">A historic
triumph.</div>

<p>I cannot tell you how it was done&mdash;I have read the speech
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" class="pagenum" title="Page 160"></a>
in the <i>Times</i> report&mdash;and I know that some people brought
away from the speech no other impression than
that it was delivered in a low tone of voice, and
was not easily grasped; but the fact is, that judged
by results this little speech, not much above half-an-hour in
duration, was one of the most extraordinary triumphs of
Mr. Gladstone's long oratorical life. What constitutes the
greatest of all Parliamentary triumphs? It is that without
abandoning your own principles, you shall so state a case
that even your bitterest political opponents will rest contented
with, and be ready to accept, your speech as the expression
of their views. And this is just what occurred.
Mr. Goschen, I have said, came down to the House chock-full
of attack&mdash;I have, indeed, heard that he has confessed to
having been prepared to make a speech of some length. On
the other side of the House there sat Labby&mdash;full of that
dogged, immutable Radicalism which will make no distinction
between Liberal and Tory when his principles of foreign
policy are at stake; and he was ready to pounce upon the
Prime Minister if he had detected any departure from the
narrow and straight path which leads to Radical salvation.
In the background were the dim forces of Unionism, more
eager&mdash;perhaps even more reckless&mdash;in readiness to attack
Mr. Gladstone than his opponents on the opposite benches.
And behind them and above them, in all parts of the House,
was that countless host of busybodies, bores and specialists
who see in Egypt an opportunity of airing fads, fanaticism,
or vanities.</p>

<div class="sn">A great
eirenicon.</div>

<p>The paper which contained the list of pairs for the night
was crammed with the names of members from
both sides, who, anticipating a debate of hours'
duration, had wisely resolved to spend the interval
between the motion and a division in the bosoms of their
families&mdash;miles away from the floor of the House of Commons.
The Whips had prepared their followers for a big
division somewhere about midnight. And, lo! on all this
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161" class="pagenum" title="Page 161"></a>
vast and turbulent sea of conflicting waves the Prime
Minister poured half an hour of oratorical oil, and the waters
were stilled, and the great deep at perfect rest. In other
words, Mr. Goschen threw away his notes; Labby advised
Sir Charles Dilke not to go to a division; the debate had not
begun and then it was over, and all that followed was
addressed to a House empty of everybody. The Old Man&mdash;dexterous,
calm, instinctive&mdash;had spoken the right word to
meet every view, and there was nothing more for anybody to
say. There is nobody else in the House who can do it; when
his voice is stilled, the greatest of all Parliamentary secrets
will die with him&mdash;the secret of saying the exact thing in the
most difficult and embarrassing of situations. To the outside
public, perhaps, this speech appeared nothing remarkable,
and the allusions to it I have seen in the press have been few
and perfunctory. You should hear House of Commons'
opinion; you should listen to Unionists who hate him, to
Tories who distrust him, to know what an estimate was
formed of this marvellous speech by House of Commons'
opinion.</p>

<div class="sn">The triumph
of the
miners.</div>

<p>On the Wednesday, again, Mr. Gladstone gave another
example of his extraordinary dexterity. The
miners had come down in full force to demand
a legal eight hours. Sam Woods, of the Ince
Division, on the one side, John Burns, of the Battersea
Fields, on the other, frowned on the Old Man and bade him
surrender. Behind him sat the great Princes of Industry&mdash;silent,
but none the less militant, fierce, and minatory;
opposite him was Lord Randolph Churchill, ready to raise
the flag of Social Democracy and to wave it before the
advancing masses against the Liberal party. Out of this
difficulty, Mr. Gladstone rescued himself with all that perfect,
that graceful ease which he most displays when
situations are most critical. The debate was further made
remarkable by a speech from Lord Randolph Churchill, who,
amid the grim and ominous silence of the Tory Benches,
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" class="pagenum" title="Page 162"></a>
thundered against Capital and Capitalists in tones for which
Trafalgar Square or the Reformers' Tree would be the
appropriate environment; and then came the remarkable
division, with 279 for the Bill and 201 against.</p>

<div class="sn">Hull Again.</div>

<p>This was not the only victory which Labour was able
to win in the course of this week. The House
presented a very notable spectacle on May 4th.
It was only by the aid of the Irish members, it is true, that
Mr. Havelock Wilson was able to get the necessary forty to
procure the adjournment of the House for the discussion of
the Hull strike; but then, when Mr. Wilson was enabled
to bring the subject before the House, he was listened to
with an attention almost painful in its seriousness and
gravity. Nothing, indeed, shows more plainly the vast social
and political changes of our time, than this transformation
in the attitude of the House of Commons towards labour
questions. There was a time&mdash;even in our own memory&mdash;when
such a question as the strike at Hull would have been
promptly ruled out of order; and when the workmen who
rose to call attention to it would have been coughed or even
hooted down; and he would be certain to receive very rough
treatment from the Tory party. The Tory party still remains
the party of the monopolists and the selfish, but it has
learned that household suffrage means a considerable weapon
in the hands of working men, and, accordingly, though it
may put its tongue in its cheek, it keeps that tongue very
civil whenever it begins to utter opinion. To Mr. Wilson,
then, the Tories, as well as the Liberals, listened with
respectful and rapt attention as he made his complaint of
employment of the military and naval forces of the Crown
in&mdash;as he alleged&mdash;the buttressing of the case of the
employers. And yet there was a something lacking. Mr.
Asquith was able to show that he had done no more than
he was compelled to do by the obligations of his office; and
entirely repudiated any idea of allowing the forces of the
Empire to be ranged on the one side or the other. Mr.
<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" class="pagenum" title="Page 163"></a>
Mundella was able to make a good defence of his officials
against the charge which had been brought by Mr. Wilson.
There was a good speech from John Burns, and it looked as
if not another sympathetic word was going to be said for
those starving men and women, who are making so heroic
a fight for the right to live. Altogether, the situation was
awkward and even distressing. The House, divided between
the desire to remain neutral and to be sympathetic, was
puzzled, constrained, and silent. It was at this moment
that Mr. Lockwood made a most welcome and appropriate
intervention. Gathering together the scattered and somewhat
tangled threads of the debate, he put to Mr. Mundella
several pertinent questions&mdash;among others, the very
relevant one, whether or not the Shipping Federation had
the right to employ sailors, whether they are not violating
the law against &quot;crimping&quot; in so doing. Incidentally, Mr.
Lockwood remarked, amid cheers from the Radical Benches&mdash;delighted
at this opportunity of departing from its painful
and embarrassed silence&mdash;that Liberal members had been
returned to support the cause of labour, and that they ought
to be true to their pledges. Mr. Gladstone at once grasped
the situation with that unerring instinct which he has displayed
so splendidly in the present Session, and at once
undertook that the point raised by Mr. Lockwood should be
considered; and so, with a word of sympathy and hope to
the strikers, Mr. Gladstone rescued the House and himself
from a painful situation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI" />CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE BILL IN COMMITTEE.</h3>


<div class="sn">The first
fence.</div>

<p>Yes, there was something intoxicating to an Irish
Nationalist&mdash;after all his weary years of waiting&mdash;in
seeing the House of Commons engaged in
Committee on the Bill which is to restore the
freedom of Ireland. And as I looked across the House on
May 8th, with every seat occupied&mdash;with galleries crowded&mdash;with
that air of tense excitement which betokens the solemn
and portentous occasion&mdash;there rose to my brain something
of the exaltation of passion's first hour. The Unionists
might rage&mdash;the Tories might obstruct&mdash;faction might bellow
its throat hoarse&mdash;Orangemen swear that they would die
rather than see Home Rule&mdash;for all that, nobody could get
over this great fact, of which I saw the palpable evidence at
that solemn and historic hour.</p>

<p>But if for a few brief moments one was inclined to
abandon oneself to the intoxication of this great hour, there
was plenty to bring one very quickly back to solid earth, and
to the sense of the long, dreary, and thorny road which
Home Rule has yet to traverse.</p>

<p>Time after time Mr. Chamberlain gets up to continue the
obstructive debate. Gravelled for matter, he clutches any topic
as a means of lengthening the thin chain of his discourse.
Mr. Redmond&mdash;the Parnellite leader&mdash;happens to be for a
few moments out of the House. Here at once, and with
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" class="pagenum" title="Page 165"></a>
eager welcome, Mr. Chamberlain seizes upon this fact to
string a few sentences together&mdash;something after this
fashion:&mdash;&quot;I observe that the hon. and learned member for
Waterford is not in his place. This is very remarkable.
Indeed, I may go further and say that this is a most sinister
fact. For we all know what the hon. and learned gentleman
has said with regard to the kind of Parliamentary supremacy
which alone he will accept. Well, now we are discussing
this very point of the Imperial supremacy, and the hon.
and learned gentleman is not in his place. I repeat,
Mr. Mellor, it is a very remarkable, a very significant, a very
sinister, and instructive fact!&quot; And so on and so on.</p>

<div class="sn">The stony
silence of
the Irishry.</div>

<p>This kind of speech had another object&mdash;it was to provoke
Mr. Redmond into a speech. For it was all
the same to the Obstructives who spoke&mdash;provided
only there was a speech. For, first, the
speech of the Irish or the Liberal member consumed so much
time in itself&mdash;and then one speech justified another; and
thus the speech by the Irishman, or the Liberal, would give
an excellent excuse for another series of harangues by the
Obstructives. And this brings me to describe one of the
portents of the present House of Commons which has excited
a great deal of attention and a great deal of unfeigned
admiration. As speakers of eloquence&mdash;as Obstructives&mdash;as
Parliamentarians of exhaustless resources&mdash;as gladiators,
tireless, brave, and cool&mdash;and, again, as stormy Parliamentary
petrels&mdash;fierce, disorderly, passionate&mdash;the Irish members
have been known to the House of Commons and to all
the world during all the long series of years through which
they have been fighting out this struggle. In this Parliament,
and at this great hour, they appear in quite another,
and perfectly new character. Amid all the groups of this
House they stand out for their unbroken and unbreakable
silence, for their unshakable self-control. Taunts, insults,
gentle and seductive invitations, are addressed to them&mdash;from
the front, from behind, from their side; they never open
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" class="pagenum" title="Page 166"></a>
their lips&mdash;the silent, stony, and eternal silence of the Sphinx
is not more inflexible. And similarly men rage, some almost
seem to threaten each other with physical violence; <i>they</i> sit
still&mdash;silent, watchful, composed. Not all, of course. There
are the young, and the vehement, and the undisciplined; but
that Old Guard which was created by Parnell&mdash;which went
with him through coercion, and the wildest of modern
agitations&mdash;which contains men that have lived for years
under the shadow of the living death of penal servitude&mdash;men
who have passed the long hours of the day&mdash;the longer
hours of the night&mdash;in the cheerless, maddening, spectral
silence of the whitewashed cells&mdash;the Old Parliamentary
Guard is silent.</p>

<p>I have been in the House of Commons for upwards of
thirteen years; and in the course of that stormy time have,
of course, seen many scenes of passion, anger, and tumult;
but the scene which ensued on May 8th, after Mr. Morley's
motion, was the worst thing I have ever beheld. I am a
lover of the British House of Commons&mdash;with all its faults,
and drawbacks, and weaknesses, it is to me the most august
assembly in the world, with the greatest history, the finest
traditions, the best oratory. And, verily, I could have wept
as I saw the House that night. It was not that the passion
was greater than I have ever seen, or the noise even, or the
dramatic excitement, it was that for hours, there was nothing
but sheer downright chaos, drivel, and anarchy.</p>

<div class="sn">The unloosing
of
anarchy.</div>

<p>It began when Mr. Mellor accepted the motion for
closure. At once there arose from the Tory
Benches wild, angry, insulting cries of &quot;Shame!
shame! scandalous! the gag! the gag!&quot; This
would have been all right if it had been addressed to Mr. Gladstone.
Party leaders have to give and take, and in moments
of excitement they must not complain if their political opponents
denounce them. But closure is the act of the presiding
officer of the House, and it has been an almost unbroken rule
and tradition of Parliament that the presiding officer shall
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" class="pagenum" title="Page 167"></a>
be safeguarded against even an approach to attack or insult.
It is a tradition that has its weak side; but, on the whole, it
is in accordance with that great national English characteristic
of subordination to necessary authority and the maintenance
of order, decency, and self-control as the trinity of public
virtues and personal demeanour. If Mr. Peel had been in
the chair he would have called those Tories to order; and if
they had persisted as they did, he would have promptly
named the highest among them. Mr. Chamberlain was not
ashamed to join in those hoarse and disorderly shouts; and
it was in this temper that the different sides walked slowly,
silently, and frowningly to the division lobbies.</p>

<p>The moment the division was over, the storm which had
been stilled broke forth again, and with wilder fury. Lord
Randolph Churchill, as I have several times remarked, is not
the man he was. I remember the time when in such a scene
he would have been perfectly at home; self-restrained, vigilant,
and effective. But on this night it was nothing above
mere inarticulateness&mdash;hoarse and ineffective fury&mdash;an almost
painful exhibition. Sometimes his lisp became so strong
that he was scarcely able to utter the words he desired to
bring out. The Prime Minister became &quot;The Primisther,&quot;
the Chief Secretary the &quot;Cheesesecry,&quot; and all this impotence
was made the more manifest by thundering on
the box with his open hand&mdash;in short, it was all inarticulate,
painful, perplexing emptiness, weakened and not
fortified by prolific tub-thumping. A poor&mdash;sad&mdash;nay, a
tragic business.</p>

<div class="sn">The young
man and
the old.</div>

<p>Such was the young man; and then came the old. To
all this inarticulate, hoarse, stammering passion,
Mr. Gladstone opposed a speech gentle, persuasive,
self-possessed; as admirable in its
courtesy as in its reserve of gigantic strength. With the
deadly pallor of his face more remarkable than ever&mdash;the
white hair shining out, as it were, with the peaceful suggestion
of calm and strong old age&mdash;in a voice, low, soft,
<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" class="pagenum" title="Page 168"></a>
gentle&mdash;Mr. Gladstone uttered a few words which revealed
all the great depths. In completely quiet, almost inaudible
tones, he uttered these pregnant words: &quot;As to other
passages in the noble lord's speech, I do not know whether
he intended to intimidate me; but if he did, I do not think
he will succeed.&quot; There they are&mdash;these few words&mdash;so
simple, plain, even commonplace; but what a history&mdash;what
a character&mdash;what a grandeur there is behind and beneath
them! So splendid are they that even Lord Randolph is
touched to the quick, and he rises to explain. The Old Man&mdash;suave,
calm, unutterably courteous&mdash;hears him politely;
and then puts the whole case of the Government in a few,
dignified, and tranquil words.</p>

<div class="sn">In the
depths.</div>

<p>But the House, exalted to a higher plane of feeling by
this great little speech, was soon dragged down
again to the arena of chaos let loose; and, of
course, Mr. Chamberlain was the person to lead
the way to the dusty pit. Mr. Mellor had very properly
attempted to stop the disorderly discussion of the closure;
but Mr. Chamberlain was not in the mood to respect the
authority of the chair or the traditions of the House of
Commons, and audaciously, shamelessly&mdash;with a perky
self-satisfaction painful to witness&mdash;he proceeded to violate
the ruling of the chair&mdash;to trample on the order of Parliament,
and to flout the Chairman. And then the waters of
the great deep were loosed. A hurricane of shouts, yells,
protests arose. Member got up after member&mdash;here, there,
everywhere&mdash;always excepting the sternly silent Irish Bench,
where sate the Irish leaders. A half-dozen men were on
their feet&mdash;all shouting, gesticulating, speaking at the same
time. In short, it was utterly unlike anything ever seen
before in the House of Commons; it brought vividly back
to the mind the tumultuous French Convention in the days
of the French Revolution.</p>

<div class="sn">Deeper and
deeper still.</div>

<p>It was almost a welcome break in this passionate and
scarcely civilized din that a personal encounter between
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" class="pagenum" title="Page 169"></a>
Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Byles for a moment interrupted
the tempest. Mr. Chamberlain, in his characteristically
genial way, had spoken of the
Irish members as having been &quot;squared.&quot;
The Irish members, habituated to insult&mdash;conscious of Mr.
Chamberlain's object&mdash;had allowed the observation to pass
unnoticed; but Mr. Byles&mdash;ardent, sincere, an enthusiast on
the Irish question&mdash;shouted out, &quot;How much would it take
to square you?&quot; At once there rose a fierce tropical storm.
There were loud shouts of approval&mdash;equally loud shouts
demanding an instant withdrawal; members rose from every
part of the House; in short, it was Bedlam let loose, and
a scene impossible to describe.</p>

<p>This was deep enough, but there was a lower depth still
to be sounded; and again it was Mr. Chamberlain's plummet
that descended down to the unfathomable bottom. &quot;I do
not,&quot; he said to Mr. Byles, &quot;object to the question, and I
will answer it by saying that it would take a great deal
more than the hon. member for Shipley will ever be able
to pay.&quot; There the words stand&mdash;in the immensity of their
vulgarity, in their unsurpassable degradation, let them lie.</p>

<div class="sn">The first
fence.</div>

<p>Finally, May 10th saw the first fence taken. The genial
and gentle T.W. Russell proposed the removal
from the Bill of the Second Chamber&mdash;the
Chamber specially created for the protection of the
loyal minority. With similar and strange unscrupulousness,
the Tories all trooped into the lobby against their own
principles. They were accompanied by a few foolish
Radicals&mdash;indeed, it was the hope of detaching a sufficient
number of Radicals to place the Government in a minority
which produced the Tory apostasy from their own principles.
There was a little uncertainty as to the result, and everybody
expected that the Government majority would have been
reduced to a dangerously low figure. When Mr. Marjoribanks
read out a majority of 51&mdash;or a majority bigger than
the usual one&mdash;there was a loud halloo of triumph and
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" class="pagenum" title="Page 170"></a>
delighted surprise from the Liberal and the Irish Benches;
and so the first big fence in the Home Rule Bill was easily
taken.</p>

<div class="sn">Obstructive
Chamberlain.</div>

<p>By the middle of the sitting on the following day the
House of Commons stood face to face with the
first clause. Under ordinary circumstances, the
clause would have been passed after a few speeches&mdash;especially
and definitely directed to the words of the
clause; Mr. Chamberlain demanded the right on this clause
to discuss, not only the whole Bill with all its other clauses,
but the past and future of the whole Home Rule struggle.
He quoted passage after passage from speeches delivered by
Irish members years and years ago; in short, he entered
upon a survey of the whole controversy. There were countless
interruptions from the Irish Benches&mdash;not in the least
because the Irish members cared for Joe's attacks, but
because such a roundabout discussion was altogether a
revolutionary departure from all previous precedents; and
would have been held distinctly out of order by any of the
predecessors of Mr. Mellor in the chair. That good-natured
and easy-going official, however, gave Mr. Chamberlain his
head; and so, for an hour, he poured forth a stream of clever,
biting, but mean and irrelevant vituperation.</p>

<div class="sn">The G.O.M.'s
greatest
speech.</div>

<p>It was well that it should have been so; for to this
speech the House of Commons owes one of the
most remarkable and historic scenes in its long
history. Every reader of Parliamentary reports
knows what it means to speak at eight o'clock. By that
time, three out of five at least of the members of the House
have gone to their dinners in all quarters of London, and the
assembly is given up to the faddists and the bores, who never
get another opportunity of delivering themselves. Nothing,
therefore, could have been more unexpected than a speech
from Mr. Gladstone at such an hour, and especially a speech
which, in the opinion of many, leaves far behind anything
he ever did. But, indeed, it is probable that Mr. Gladstone
<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" class="pagenum" title="Page 171"></a>
himself had no notion when the sitting began, or even a few
minutes before he rose, that he would say anything very
special. It is one of the peculiarities of this extraordinary
man to be always surprising you. His infinite variety, his
boundless resource, seem to be without any limitations. By
this time, you would have expected that one who had listened
to him for nearly twenty years would imagine that he had no
further oratorical worlds to conquer, and that he certainly
would not have waited to his eighty-fourth year to do something
better than ever he had done before. But so it was.
In passion, in destructive sarcasm, in dramatic force, in the
rush and resistless sweep of language, Mr. Gladstone was
more potent in the dinner hour of that Thursday night than
he was ever at any other single moment in his almost sixty
years of triumphant oratory.</p>

<div class="sn">His powers
as a mimic.</div>

<p>Observers are divided as to his temper when he rose.
Some onlookers, observing the tremendous force
of voice and language&mdash;the broad, ample, and
frequent gestures&mdash;the tremulousness that sometimes
underlies the swell of passion&mdash;the deadly and startling
pallor of the face&mdash;thought that he was suffering from excitement
almost touching and perhaps affrighting to behold; while
others thought that the chief and most impressive feature of
this perfect tornado of triumphant eloquence, was the perfect
calm that lay in the heart and bosom of all that storm. There
are two things which will tell you of the omnipotence of an
orator&mdash;one is the effect of his speech on foes as well as
friends, and the other is its effect upon himself. Both these
evidences were present, for the Tories seemed to have been
swept away by the cyclone as resistlessly as the Liberals and
the Irish, and the Tory p&aelig;ans in honour of the Old Man
which were to be found in the Tory organs next day only
echoed the bounteous and generous recognition of his
matchless powers which one heard from Tories in the lobbies
throughout the evening. And as to the effect of the speech
on Mr. Gladstone himself, it was to bring out a dramatic and
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" class="pagenum" title="Page 172"></a>
mimetic power on which he very rarely ventures, and which
in anybody but a perfect master of the House of Commons
might descend into bad taste and bad tact. I know that
Mr. Gladstone is really triumphant when he brings these
qualities into requisition. I remember the last time he used
them with any approach to the abundance of this occasion
was when he was making the great speech which preceded
his defeat in 1885 and the fall of his Government. On that
occasion I remember very well that the Old Man puckered
up his forehead into a thousand wrinkles, turned and twisted
that very wonderfully mobile mouth of his&mdash;with its lips so
full with strength and at the same time so sensitive with all
the Celtic passion of his Highland ancestry&mdash;until sometimes
you almost thought it a pity he had not taken to the Lyceum
and some of the great parts in which Mr. Henry Irving has
made his fame. There was another occasion which dwells in
my memory. It was on one of the nights of the debate on
the Coercion Bill. He was describing the promises of equal
laws to Ireland, with the restrictions on Irish liberty which
were contained in the Bill, and as he described restriction he
gradually raised the fingers on one hand, then turned them
spiral fashion until he had pointed the index finger to the
roof&mdash;- as though he were describing the ascent of a funambulist
to the top of spiral stairs. It was at once eloquent and
grotesque, and the House cheered and cheered yet again without
any distinction of party&mdash;the friends in admiration of
the splendid eloquence of the gesture, the foes in hearty admiration
of the great and perennial spirit of the great Old Man.</p>

<div class="sn">Comedy.</div>

<p>But on May 11th there was a new and a bolder departure.
Most of my readers have seen that remarkable
little lay written by Mr. Gilbert for Miss Anderson
to display the range and variety of her powers&mdash;&quot;Comedy
and Tragedy.&quot; Mr. Gladstone gave proof of powers of
equally wide versatility; and all at the expense of poor Joe.
First for the Comedy. I must quote the passage of the
speech to explain what I
mean:&mdash;<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" class="pagenum" title="Page 173"></a></p>

<p>&quot;My right hon. friend has a bundle of quotations. He
says he has fortified himself. (Laughter.) He said he had
fortified himself against me when I said there could be no
supremacy without the presence of Irish members in this
House. I never asserted anything of the kind. (Cheers.)
'Oh,' he said, 'I have got the papers'&mdash;(laughter)&mdash;and the
party opposite cheered at the expected triumph. (Laughter.)&quot;</p>

<p>When Mr. Gladstone came to the words. &quot;'Oh,' he said,
'I have got the papers,'&quot; Mr. Gladstone began fumbling in
his pockets, just as Mr. Chamberlain had done&mdash;with that air
of distraction and coming despair which appears on everybody's
face when he is anxiously seeking for an important
but mislaid paper; and the resemblance, heightened by just
the least imitation of Mr. Chamberlain's voice, was so striking,
so startling, so melodramatic, that the whole House,
Tories and all, joined in the wild delight of laughter and
cheers&mdash;laughter at the comic power, delight at the splendid
courage and exuberant spirit of the prancing old war-horse,
delighted, exhilarated, and fortified by the joy of battle and
by the richness of his own powers and courage. Even yet
the comic vein was not exhausted. Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;as I
have said&mdash;had made copious quotations from past Irish
speeches, and asked that they should be retracted. &quot;If the
work of retraction were to begin, is my right hon. friend,&quot;
asked Mr. Gladstone, with scorn in every tone, &quot;willing to
submit himself to the same process of examination? If the
work of retraction were to begin he would have a lot to do.&quot;
And then came the passage which has already passed into
Parliamentary history. &quot;If we are to stand in white sheets,
my right hon. friend would have to wear that ornamental
garment standing in a very conspicuous position.&quot;</p>

<div class="sn">and Tragedy.</div>

<p>And then came the other and the tragic note. Again I
have to quote the exact words to convey the impression
and explain the description:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;If I were in the position of one of those gentlemen&mdash;if I
had seen the wrongs and the sufferings of Ireland in former
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" class="pagenum" title="Page 174"></a>
times, if the iron had entered into my soul as it had entered
into theirs, it would have been impossible. I should not
have been more temperate possibly than some of them under
those circumstances of the language I used. (Cheers.)&quot;</p>

<p>It was when he uttered the words, &quot;if the iron had
entered into my soul,&quot; that Mr. Gladstone ventured on the
bold gesture of striking his hand against his breast&mdash;a simple
gesture, and not an uncommon gesture in itself&mdash;but you
should have heard the resonant and thrilling voice&mdash;you
should have been under the entrancing and almost bewildering
spell beneath which at this moment all the imagination
and emotion of the House lay supine, helpless, and drugged&mdash;to
have understood the shiver of feeling which passed
through everybody. And so he went on&mdash;rising higher and
higher&mdash;a deeper harmony in every note&mdash;a more splendid
strength in every sentence&mdash;till you almost thought you were
looking at some great bird&mdash;with the strength and splendour
of the eagle, the full-hearted and passionate melody of the
lark&mdash;as it soared on, on its even and well-poised wing,
higher and higher to the dim and blue ether of the
upper air.</p>

<div class="sn">A strange
scene.</div>

<p>Right to the last word, there was the same unbroken,
passionate strength and fervour, so that when it
was all ended the House gave a start as though it
had to rouse itself from some splendid vision.
And then came that rude and quick awakening which, in the
world of actualities, always bursts in upon the most solemn
and moving hours. At about half-past eight every evening
the Speaker or Chairman&mdash;whichever is in the chair&mdash;gets
up and goes out to tea. Before doing so the presiding officer
calls upon the next speaker, and when the speaker has been
named, cries &quot;Order, order!&quot; and promptly disappears into
the room where his meal is laid. Scarcely had Mr. Gladstone
sat down when Mr. Mellor called upon Sir Richard
Temple, then cried &quot;Order, order!&quot; and, almost within a
couple of seconds after Mr. Gladstone had concluded, had
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" class="pagenum" title="Page 175"></a>
vanished from the House. This was immediately followed
by the stampede of the rest of the House&mdash;for by half-past
eight everybody was famished with hunger&mdash;and the Chamber
was left empty, silent, and dim, with a suddenness that was
startling, disconcerting, and a little disillusioning. And then
it was that the strongest proof was given of the effect of the
speech.</p>

<div class="sn">The outburst.</div>

<p>The House, I say, became empty&mdash;but not altogether.
The Irish Benches, which had become crowded as
the great apology for Ireland was being pronounced,
remained still full&mdash;full, but silent.
There was something strange, weird, startling in those
benches, full and yet silent, amid all this emptiness and
almost audible stillness; and some of the Liberal members,
who had left the House in the mad rush to dinner, quietly
stole back to see what was going to happen. The explanation
of the mystery soon came. After he sat down, ghastly
pale, almost painfully panting after this tremendous effort,
Mr. Gladstone tarried a little to recover himself&mdash;to say a
few words to Mr. John Morley&mdash;to scribble a note. At last
he rose, and then came the moment for which those silent
Irish Benches had been waiting. With one accord, with one
quick and simultaneous spring, the Irish members were on
their feet&mdash;hats and handkerchiefs were waved; there was
the suggestion of tears under the swelling cheers. Nor were
the Irish left alone. The Liberals who had slipped back
joined in. The effectiveness of their cheers was heightened
by the fact that they were not in their places, but standing
on the floor. From out their cheering ranks stood the
splendid figure&mdash;the broad shoulders, the massive head, the
shaggy beard and hair, all the virility and sensitiveness that
are found in the splendid form of Mr. Allen&mdash;manufacturer
and workman, poet and Radical. The Old Man, splendidly
composed, and yet profoundly moved, looked back, gave a
courtly bow, and then went out. And here it was that a
little scene took place of which the public prints have hitherto
<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176" class="pagenum" title="Page 176"></a>
contained no mention. In her corner place in the gallery
had sat throughout this dazzling speech that best of friends
and truest of wives, who has been the guardian angel of Mr.
Gladstone's life; and with outstretched hands and dim eyes,
she received her triumphant husband in the corridor, where
she had been waiting for him.</p>

<div class="sn">Deeper and
deeper.</div>

<p>Friday, May 12th, I may dismiss in a few words. As
the closure had been refused on Thursday night,
the Obstructives started again on the first clause
on Friday afternoon&mdash;Mr. T.W. Russell leading
the van. He had nothing to say beyond what he had said a
hundred times already, even in the course of the present
Session; and his speech would have passed unnoticed had it
not been for a brisk but odious and ignoble little storm which
he and the Tories managed to raise between them. Mr.
Russell declared that he heard the phrase across the floor,
&quot;What the devil are you saying?&quot; and stopped as if the
heavens and the earth must refuse to go round on their axes
because of this introduction into Parliament of the negligences
of private conversation. Mr. Gibbs&mdash;a very pestilent
and very empty member of the young army of silly obstructives&mdash;moved
that the words be taken down&mdash;an ancient
formula not heard of for years till the present Session, when
everything is turned to account for the purpose of occupying
time and breaking down the House of Commons, and at the
same time accused Mr. Swift McNeill of having used the
words. Mr. McNeill indignantly denied the charge: then
Mr. Macartney attributed them to Mr. Sexton&mdash;another and
equally indignant denial; and then much uproar and contradictions
and apologies&mdash;the lubberly and unmannerly interventions
of Lord Cranborne as usual conspicuous&mdash;and,
finally, the end of the storm in a teacup. Positively loathsome&mdash;the
whole business methods of the Tories to grasp at
everything to rouse a storm or provoke a scene; and altogether
disheartening to those who don't wish to see the
House of Commons reduced to the drivel and turbulence and
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" class="pagenum" title="Page 177"></a>
anarchy of a French Convention. Finally, a little after six
o'clock, the first clause of the Bill had passed, with a majority
of 42. The House of Commons had decided that there shall
be established in Ireland a Legislature of two Chambers.
Then in a graceful, well-delivered, and pleasant little speech,
Mr. Victor Cavendish opened the fight on the second clause.
The evening was devoted to the Anti-vaccinationists&mdash;answered
triumphantly in an admirable and unanswerable
little speech by Sir Walter Foster&mdash;with as many as seventy
men voting against vaccination. I had no idea previously
that the proportion of lunatics in the Assembly was so
large.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII" />CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>RENEWAL OF THE FIGHT.</h3>


<div class="sn">A fresh
start.</div>

<p>Nothing of memorable importance occurred during the
week before the Whitsuntide holidays, but with
Tuesday, May 30th, came the renewal of the
great battle over Home Rule. The Old Man was
first to be observed. He looked very fresh and sunny, but,
at the same time, had that slightly deepened pallor which he
always has on the first day of a Session&mdash;the result of the long
day's journey which he has gone through in coming from
his country house. Mr. Balfour was also in his place, looking
as though the open rivalry of Lord Randolph Churchill
had not much affected his spirits. Mr. Chamberlain
nearly always looks the same. He has himself informed the
world that he does not take exercise in any shape or form
whatsoever, and there is never therefore, on his cheek that
look of deep-drunk sunshine which marks the cheeks of more
active men. But he was ready for the conflict, and as the
night went on showed there was no decrease in either the
venom or the vehemence with which he means to fight
against the Home Rule Bill. On the Irish Benches nearly
every man was in his place, and the Tories had so far benefited
by their buffetings from the <i>Times</i> as to make a
braver show than they usually do in the early days after
vacation.</p>

<div class="sn">Home Rule
once more.</div>

<p>When the House separated, the subject under debate was
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" class="pagenum" title="Page 179"></a>
an audacious proposal to postpone Clause 3. There
was nothing whatever to be urged in favour
of such a proposal; it was pure, unadulterated,
shameless obstruction. But Sir Richard Temple
is not gifted with a sense of humour, and on this amendment
he wandered and maundered away for the better part of an
hour. The House has yet no power to prevent a bore from
consuming its time; but it is free to save itself from the yoke
of attention. By a sort of general spontaneity, everybody left
his seat; and though hapless Mr. Balfour was forced by the
hard necessities of his official position to remain in his place,
nobody else was compelled to do so; and Sir Richard
addressed the general, void, encasing air. There was some
more speech-making of the like kind&mdash;still to empty air&mdash;when
suddenly and almost unexpectedly the debate was
allowed to collapse. At first, this was unintelligible&mdash;for,
senseless as was the amendment, it was no worse than scores
of others which the Tories have made the pretext for endless
debates.</p>

<div class="sn">A tight
division.</div>

<p>However, the division revealed the secret. It is one of
the peculiarities of this strangely interesting
Session that nearly every division is a picturesque
and portentous event. With a majority so small
as forty, the turnover of a very few votes from one side to
the other may mean the defeat of Home Rule, the downfall
of Gladstone and his Government, and chaos come again.
And these accidents are always possible. Death knocks at
the door of the families of members of Parliament as of other
people; and often, when one of the great divisions is pending,
the Whips have to consider the grim and painful question
whether they can allow a man to remain by the rack on which
a wife lies tortured, or receive a loving mother's parting sigh.
For some reason or other, Tuesday was a bad day for the
Liberals, and there was a series of ugly and annoying little
mishaps. Thus, in the first division, which was snatched
quickly by the Tories, informed by their scouts of what
<a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" class="pagenum" title="Page 180"></a>
was going on, the majority sank to thirty-three. This
was a bad beginning, but worse, as will be seen, remained
behind.</p>

<div class="sn">Lord
Wolmer.</div>

<p>The Committee was now on Clause 3. This is the clause
which contains the list of the subjects on which
the Irish Legislature is not to have the right to
legislate&mdash;such questions as the succession to the
Crown, questions of peace and war, foreign treaties, coinage,
copyright, trade, etc. The list is comprehensive enough, but
it was not comprehensive enough for Lord Wolmer; for he
had an amendment to the effect that the Irish Legislature
should not be allowed to pass even resolutions on these subjects.
But even his own amendment did not satisfy him. He
amended the amendment by further proposing that the Irish
Legislature should not be allowed even to &quot;discuss&quot; any of
these questions. The speech in favour of these proposals
started from the point of departure common to all the
Unionists, namely, that the Irish people were hereditary and
irreconcilable enemies, and that the moment they had a native
Legislature, it would immediately proceed to make alliances
with every Power in the world which was hostile to the
British Empire. There was France; of course, the Irish
Legislature would pass a resolution of sympathy with France
in case there was a war between France and England. Then
there was the United States; what was there to prevent the
Irish Executive from sending an envoy to the United States?
And so on, through all the possibilities and all the insanity
and malignity of which an Irish Legislature could be held
capable.</p>

<div class="sn">Sweet and
low.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone on one or two points was able to overthrow
the whole case so elaborately made up. The
Irish Parliament could not send representatives
to a foreign Power, because they could not vote
the money for such a purpose under the Bill. &quot;Ah, but&quot;&mdash;interrupted
the incautious Wolmer&mdash;&quot;could they not send
envoys who were unpaid?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; promptly responded
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" class="pagenum" title="Page 181"></a>
the Old Man, &quot;because they had no power under the Bill to
'accredit' envoys, and a foreign Power could not receive an
envoy who was not accredited.&quot; All this argument&mdash;broad,
acute, tranquil&mdash;was delivered in a voice that now and then
was painfully low, and sometimes you had to strain your ears.
But then it was worth your while to strain your ears, so that
you might master all the supremacy of the art and skill and
knowledge of the whole speech.</p>

<p>For instance, he puts the question to Lord Wolmer, if he
seriously means that the Irish Legislature is not to have the
right to petition? Lord Wolmer answers that the Irish
members will be in the Imperial Parliament. &quot;Ah! that's
an argument, not an answer,&quot; says the Old Man; and then,
with the spring of a tiger, he pounces on the hapless Wolmer
with the question: &quot;Is the right of petition, then, to be
taken away in every case where there is representation?&quot;&mdash;a
question which, with petitions pouring in by the thousand to
the House of Commons from the Ulstermen and others, a
Unionist like Lord Wolmer finds it impossible to answer.
And it is in connection with this point a little scene occurs
which brings out many of the points in this remarkable
speech, which I have been trying to make clear. Mr. Bryce
disappears from the House; then he returns: Mr. Gladstone
asks him a question; the answer is apparently not satisfactory,
for the Old Man lifts his hands to heaven in playful exaggeration
of surprise. The House, puzzled, does not know what
it means; but the Old Man soon explains. He had sent Mr.
Bryce to the Library to get a copy of the recent Life of Lord
Sherbrooke&mdash;Robert Lowe, that was&mdash;and Mr. Bryce had
brought back the discomforting intelligence that the book was
not there. However, with such a memory as Mr. Gladstone's,
this does not matter, for he is able to point out that an
Australian Legislature had at one time passed a resolution,
and agreed on a petition to the Imperial Parliament, in reference
to the Corn Laws. Just fancy the keenness, the omnivorousness,
the promptitude of that marvellous Old Man, who
<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" class="pagenum" title="Page 182"></a>
had read one of the most recently published works, and had
promptly seized on a point bearing reference to a detail in his
Bill.</p>

<div class="sn">A pathetic
scene.</div>

<p>And then came the pathetic scene, in which again Mr.
Bryce figured, and which once more brought out
the marvellous grasp, the tenacious and inevitable
memory of the splendid Old Man. The amendment
of Lord Wolmer was, declared Mr. Gladstone, against
&quot;the law of Parliament,&quot; and, by way of emphasizing this
point, he wanted to have a quotation made from Sir Erskine
May's Book on Parliament. But the eyesight of age is weak,
and there is in the House of Commons, until the gas is lit,
something of the dim, religious light of a cathedral, and,
accordingly, Mr. Gladstone had to rely on the younger eyes
of Mr. Bryce. The scene which followed might be described
as out of order, for there were two members standing at the
same time. But the vast ascendancy of Mr. Gladstone over
the assembly&mdash;the profound reverence in which all, save the
meanest, bow before his genius, character, and age&mdash;enable
him to do things not permitted to common men. In the rapt
and serious face, in the attentive look, in the fingers beating
the table as word followed word in confirmation of this view&mdash;in
the curious, almost weird and unusual sight of two men
standing side by side, Mr. Gladstone silent, Mr. Bryce speaking&mdash;there
was a scene, the impressiveness, poetry, and pathos
of which will never pass from the memory of those who saw
it. And the House&mdash;so quick, with all its passion, and
fractiousness, and meannesses, at grasping the significance of
a great and solemn moment&mdash;marked its sense of the scene
by a stillness that was almost audible&mdash;a hush that spoke
aloud.</p>

<div class="sn">And yet
another.</div>

<p>There was just one other incident in this marvellous little
speech which must be noted. I have remarked
the ofttimes the voice of Mr. Gladstone was so
low, that it was with difficulty one could hear
him. The reason is curious, and is revealed in a little
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" class="pagenum" title="Page 183"></a>
gesture that has only come in recent years, and that has
a melancholy interest. Often now, when he is speaking,
Mr. Gladstone puts his hand to his right ear, as men
do who are making a laborious effort to catch and concentrate
sound. The cause of this is that Mr. Gladstone's
hearing has become defective, and he has to adopt this
little stratagem to make his own voice audible to himself.
You should see the Old Man with his hand to his
ear, with the look of gentle anxiety on his face, to understand
all this little gesture conveys; and how it exalts
your sense of the mighty courage of this great Old Man,
who is able to rise thus superior to all obstacles, to all
foes, to all weaknesses of the flesh, all devices of the
enemy.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Balfour.</div>

<p>Mr. Balfour, I have said more than once, does not display
his talents best in Opposition. In his desire to
be effective, he strains a not very strong voice
until, it sounds almost like a shriek. I do not wish to be
unfair to Mr. Balfour. There is, as I have often said in
these columns, a certain distinction in all he does. I often
think he is wanting in that consideration and reverence for
the mighty old gladiator whom it is his duty to oppose; but
for all this I make allowance, as it is his duty to oppose Mr.
Gladstone, and in doing that, he may sometimes appear
unintentionally irreverent. But the fact is, Mr. Balfour is
thin, narrow, and does not get at the reality of things. Many
people say he is very inferior to Mr. Chamberlain; but most
assuredly I do not in the least agree with this opinion. To
me the difference between the two men is the difference
between a scholar and a counter-jumper&mdash;I mean a counter-jumper
of the Senate, and not of the shop. But though
that is my opinion, I cannot refrain from saying that Mr.
Balfour contrasts very unfavourably with Mr. Gladstone in
this struggle of giants.</p>

<div class="sn">An ugly
moment.</div>

<p>It was during the speech of Mr. Balfour that a little
incident took place, the full significance of which would
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" class="pagenum" title="Page 184"></a>
probably not be grasped by the non-Parliamentarian. Mr.
Balfour was arguing that it was impossible to
properly discuss the amendment of Lord Wolmer
until the House knew whether or not the Irish
members were going to be retained in the Imperial Parliament.
I do not know whether it was because there was
something provocative in the manner in which Mr. Balfour
referred to this subject, but it had the effect of rousing the
once vulnerable, but now admirably controlled temper,
which has played such a part in Mr. Gladstone's career.
Rising with a certain deepened pallor, and with that feverish
rush in his voice which those who watch him know so well
he said that the Ministry meant to stick by the ninth clause,
and would do their very best to get it accepted by the House.
Here was a most portentous announcement&mdash;the portentousness
of which the careful observer could see at once, by the
sudden stillness which fell upon the House. Whenever a
Minister, or even a politician of small importance who is not
a Minister, makes a statement full of portentous possibilities
as to the future, the House suddenly becomes still and tense,
and you can hear a pin drop. It is the prompt and sometimes
almost irresistible expression of the feeling that Destiny
is throwing the die, and that you have to watch the grim and
fateful result.</p>

<div class="sn">The Treasury
Bench looks
awkward.</div>

<p>And if you looked on the Treasury Bench, you could see
that the feeling was not altogether comfortable.
It was no secret that the ninth clause was the
one which offered to the Government the one
perilous fence they had still to take&mdash;that is to say, so far
as their own followers were concerned. Hitherto the attitude
of the Government was quite unknown; and, indeed, it was
quite probable that the Government themselves had not
finally decided what their attitude should be. But when Mr.
Gladstone&mdash;pale, excited, and angry&mdash;jumped in with this
outburst, it seemed all at once as if the fateful and final
word of Destiny had been spoken, and as if the whole fate
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" class="pagenum" title="Page 185"></a>
of Ireland, of Mr. Gladstone, of this great Ministry, and of
this mighty Bill, had been definitely pledged to one throw
of the dice. Imagine one of those contests which you find
in the pages of Turgenieff or Tolstoi, which perchance you
may have seen at Monte Carlo, which in the last few days
may have been observed at Epsom Downs&mdash;in which life or
death, ruin or halcyon fortune, depended on one throw&mdash;and
you can have some sense of all that passed through the
imagination of the House and that made it almost audibly
shiver when Mr. Gladstone made this slight and terse
interruption. Mr. Morley's face&mdash;serious, often sombre&mdash;cast
in a mould and reflective of a soul inclined to the
darker rather than the more cheerful view of life's tangled and
unsatisfactory workings&mdash;grew black and troubled; the other
Ministers who were present looked&mdash;not so eloquently, but
still perceptibly&mdash;uncomfortable; Mr. Asquith&mdash;who had
been a close observer&mdash;could not keep his keen anxiety from
breaking through the mask of easy equanimity with which
he is able to clothe his readiness to meet fortune in all her
moods; in short, it was for Ministerialists one of those
uncomfortable quarters of an hour in which life seems to
concentrate all its bitterness, sorrow, and anxieties within a
terribly brief space of time. And if you wanted to know
further what was the full significance of what had taken
place, you saw it in the open and almost indecent joy of Mr.
Chamberlain's face; in the more subdued but a still unctuous
look of Mr. Courtney; and you could hear it in the shriller
pitch of Mr. Balfour's voice.</p>

<div class="sn">A false
alarm.</div>

<p>But all the same, it was a false alarm. For if the Old
Man had tripped, he was able to recover himself
very soon. Mr. Balfour was foolish enough to
try and dot the &quot;I's,&quot; and to put into Mr.
Gladstone's mouth that which his enemies hoped he had
said. For Mr. Balfour, remarking that Mr. Gladstone had
made a more explicit declaration than any which had yet
come from his lips&mdash;this was all right, and was quite
true&mdash;<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" class="pagenum" title="Page 186"></a>went
on to the further statement that the Old Man had now
committed himself to standing or falling by the ninth
clause &quot;in its present shape.&quot; This, you will see, was the
whole crux of the situation. If Mr. Gladstone had said
this, then, indeed, it might go hard with him by-and-bye,
for whether the Liberal party would accept the ninth clause
in its present shape was one of the questions yet to be
decided. The Old Man, however his words might have been
open to this construction, had not in reality said anything
of the kind. And, at once, he was prompt to see how
necessary it was to correct this error, for he immediately
rose to his feet to say that he had never said anything of
the sort. What he had said was that the Government
intended to stand by the principle that the Irish members
were to have a place in the Imperial Parliament, which, it
will be seen, leaves open the perilous and perplexing
question: what form that representation in the Imperial
Parliament is to take. At once there was a heavy sigh of
relief, and most of all on the Irish Benches. Among the
Irishry, the declaration of Mr. Gladstone had produced a
moment of something like panic; the only exhibition of
which was a certain impatience with the attempt of Mr.
Balfour to pin the Old Man down to the most literal interpretation
of his words. The panic soon passed away. It
was all, I say, a false alarm. Vulnerable though his temper&mdash;though
there was in him still enough of the hot onrush
of battle and of resistance under all the snow of advancing
years&mdash;the great old tactician had not forgotten his cunning.
He at once seized the opportunity of saying he was not
finally committed to the ninth clause in its present shape,
and so we once more breathed freely.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe comes
back from
dinner.</div>

<p>This was the end of the important part of the debate
before the dinner hour. It is one of the peculiarities
of Mr. Chamberlain that no stress of a
Parliamentary situation induces him to seriously
interfere with his habits. When the clock points to ten
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" class="pagenum" title="Page 187"></a>
minutes to eight any evening of the week, he may be seen
to rise from his place with the inevitableness of fate, and to
disappear for a couple of hours. I have seen him do this
even when the fortune of a most important amendment
seemed to lie trembling in the balance&mdash;the one occasion on
which I have known him to break through that rigid rule
was when his son was about to make that maiden speech
which started that promising young fellow on his Parliamentary
career. Coming back like a giant refreshed about
ten o'clock, Mr. Chamberlain contrived to once more set
aflame the embers of dying passion; and he threw himself
into the fight over Lord Wolmer's amendment at the
moment when all life seemed to have gone out of it. His
speech was full of cleverness&mdash;of what the Americans call
smartness, and it had all that point, personal and party,
which sets your friends in a roar. The Tories cheered him
vociferously, and point after point of brilliant and effective
invective pleased the House&mdash;always anxious with its jaded
appetite for a sensation. But when you had time to compare,
it with that little speech delivered by Mr. Gladstone earlier
in the evening&mdash;when you contrasted its fitful and gaudy
brilliancy with the sober and broad wisdom of Mr. Gladstone's
utterance&mdash;then, indeed, you were able to see what a gulf there
is between the smart debater and the genuine statesman.</p>

<div class="sn">A narrow
shave.</div>

<p>At last the debate was over; and then came what was,
perhaps, the most exciting and most momentous
incident of the evening. I have already spoken
of the interest with which every division is
regarded. The interest in this particular division was fully
justified when the numbers were told; for the Government
majority had fallen to twenty-one. At once there was a wild
outburst of cheering from the Tory Benches. Some wits
ventured on the cry, &quot;Resign! Resign!&quot;&mdash;altogether, the
Tories had the best quarter of an hour they have enjoyed
since that hideous afternoon before the Easter vacation,
when, after a prolonged fight, the Old Man had to announce
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" class="pagenum" title="Page 188"></a>
that he could not propose the second reading of the Bill
until after Easter. It was all more or less of an accident;
there were plenty of things to account for it&mdash;a reception at
the House of a prominent Liberal lady, and many other
explanations: but, all the same, it was a very ugly little
incident; and though Mr. Gladstone carried it off with that
indomitable courage of his, which doesn't know what a
confession of defeat means, one could see that he did not
like it; and for the rest of the evening there was a visible
gloom in the Liberal ranks.</p>

<div class="sn">Happy again.</div>

<p>But May 31st brought the Derby, and with the Derby
there came upon the Tory Benches one of those
moments of temptation which the natural man
is utterly unable to resist. The amendments followed each
other in rapid succession; division came on top of division;
and in them all the Liberals jumped back to their old
superiority of numbers. In the earlier part of the day,
when the fortunes of Isinglass were still undetermined, the
majorities were enormous; and though there was a certain
falling off when sporting gentlemen began to get back from
the dusty Downs, the average was well kept up; and it was
with a distinct rise in the temperature of Liberal hopes and
confidence that this stage was reached. On the following
day the lowness of the voice in the Old Man was a little
more perceptible, and when it got to midnight, he seemed
painfully fagged and exhausted. It was, perhaps, because
he was in that mood that he made some concessions to the
Unionists, which have been somewhat resented. But as
these concessions, according to Mr. Gladstone himself, only
carried out what the Government had intended from the
first, these things may be passed. They had reference chiefly
to prohibition of raising in Ireland anything like a military
force&mdash;even in the shape of a militia or volunteer force. On
June 2nd, there was one of those transformations in which
the Old Man is constantly surprising friends and foes. He
was alert, vigorous, watchful of everything that went on,
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" class="pagenum" title="Page 189"></a>
and the voice rose to its old strength and resonance. It
was during that afternoon that there was a slight indication
for the first time throughout the progress of the whole Bill
of any dissatisfaction on the part of the Irish members.
Mr. Byrne&mdash;one of the Unionist gang of lawyers&mdash;proposed
a ridiculous amendment, the effect of which would have
been that the Irish Legislature would not have had the right
to give a license for a fowling-piece, or to arm their police
to meet a rising of the Orangemen.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Sexton
intervenes.</div>

<p>It was then that Mr. Sexton intervened with a word of
warning against such a restriction. In burning
though carefully restrained language, Mr. Sexton
replied to a taunt of Mr. Chamberlain at the
silence of the Irish members. Their silence, said Mr. Sexton,
was due to their knowledge that Mr. Chamberlain and his
confederates had entered into a conspiracy to destroy the
power of the House of Commons, and to defeat the mandate
of the nation by obstructing a Bill they could not otherwise
defeat. Spoken with great fire&mdash;with splendid choice of
language&mdash;with biting sarcasm, of which he is a master&mdash;the
speech was an event. Mr. Gladstone promptly recognized
its spirit; thanked the Irish members for their consideration;
and then declared, amid a great sniff from Joe's upturned
nose, that if the Irish members desired to express their
opinions on any amendment, he and his colleagues would
wait before expressing their own views. There seemed to be
a slight hope among the Tories and the ever-venomous Joe
that this meant a rift in the lute between the Irish members
and the Government; but they were woefully disappointed&mdash;especially
when the amendment was indignantly rejected
by the House.</p>

<div class="sn">The &quot;Daily
News.&quot;</div>

<p>It is the outspoken, rather than the loudly uttered, that is
often the important thing in a House of Commons
discussion. This was the case with the
curious little debate which Mr. Chamberlain
initiated on June 6th. The <i>Daily News</i> had published a little
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" class="pagenum" title="Page 190"></a>
article describing the manner in which the Tories had
shouted at&mdash;hooted&mdash;interrupted&mdash;Mr. Gladstone on the
Thursday night previous. It may at once be asked why Mr.
Chamberlain should have thought it necessary to notice the
article. He boasted that he was not in the habit of noticing
what appeared against him in the newspapers&mdash;which is not
true to a certain extent, or at least is not generally so
thought, for it is understood that no man reads more carefully
the extracts sent to him by those press-cutting agencies
which have added either a new luxury or a new terror to
public life. But Mr. Chamberlain's action had many roots.
First, like many others, very free in their comments and
attacks, he is almost childishly sensitive. Watch him in the
House of Commons when an attack is being made upon him
which he does not like, and the fierce and domineering
temper reveals itself in the fidgety movement, the darkened
brow, the deeper pallor on the white-complexioned face.
When he was a Cabinet Minister he could never, or rarely,
be got to remain in the House of Commons during the whole
of the evening; and one of the chief reasons, I have heard,
he gave for thus absenting himself was that he could not
stand the talk from the opposite side&mdash;it made him so angry.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe's motives.</div>

<p>But there were other and more immediate reasons for his
anger with the <i>Daily News</i>. Joe was conscious of
the growth of two feelings&mdash;either of which was
very perilous to him. First, he began uneasily to feel that the
country&mdash;watching the struggle between him and the Old
Man&mdash;was getting a little disgusted at the business; and saw
in it a want of that chivalry and fair play which it desires to
see even in the fiercest political controversy. This was not a
pleasant sentiment to have growing up against one; and Joe
felt that it has serious perils to his future political position.
And, secondly, he was conscious that the majority of the
House of Commons was growing very restive under the
desperate obstruction of which he had made himself the
champion, and that this feeling might soon become strong
<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" class="pagenum" title="Page 191"></a>
enough to carry Mr. Gladstone and the Ministers off their
feet, and compel drastic measures which had hitherto been
steadily refrained from. This would not suit the book of
Joe at all, whose object it was to keep the struggle going as
long as he possibly could manage it, careless of the traditions
of Parliament, of the dignity and decency of the House of
Commons, of the life and strength of Mr. Gladstone, of
everything except his own greedy desire for personal revenge
and triumph.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Gladstone's
gentleness.</div>

<p>This was what lay behind the plausible and honeyed
words in which Mr. Chamberlain attacked the
article in the <i>Daily News</i>. And here a curious
difficulty arose which rather helped Joe, and
almost enabled him to score a great triumph. Everybody
knows that between the temper of Mr. Gladstone and that of
his friends and supporters there is an impassable gulf. That
mastery of a vulnerable temper, which accounted for many of
the troubles of his earlier political career, which he himself
has acknowledged in many a pathetic passage in his correspondence&mdash;that
mastery of the vulnerable temper is now so
complete that the Old Man glides through scenes of insult and
passes over what the humblest member of the House would
often find it hard to endure. There is something indeed
strange, wistful, almost uncanny, in the unbreakable gentleness
of that white figure, with the ivory complexion,
the scant white hair, the large white collar and broad white
shirt-front&mdash;there is something which becomes almost an
obsession to the observer in watching the figure with its
strangely tranquil and gentle expression in the heat and
centre of all this fierce Parliamentary battle.</p>

<div class="sn">And eagerness.</div>

<p>And what makes it all the more peculiar is that this
strange gentleness does not go side by side with
want of interest in the struggle. On the contrary,
all those around him and near him declare that
never has Mr. Gladstone been more keen of any subject than
he has been on this Home Rule Bill. He thinks of nothing
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" class="pagenum" title="Page 192"></a>
else; he enjoys it all. I saw a curious instance of this
intensity of his interest about that time. Having a word to
say to one of the Ministers, I was seated for a moment on
the Treasury Bench just beside the Chairman&mdash;Mr. Mellor.
Mr. Gladstone had gone out for a few minutes. Sir William
Harcourt was in charge of the Bill, and he was replying to
some argument of the Unionists opposite. Sir William
Harcourt has an excellent method of dealing with futile and
dishonest amendments. He declines to argue them in detail.
With that rich humour of which the public know less than
his friends and intimates, Sir William
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;arily&quot; in the original text">airily</ins>
dismisses the
whole business, and with a laugh brings down shivering to
the ground a whole fabric of laboriously constructed
nonsense. Well, Sir William was in the middle of a
sentence in which he was speaking of the absurd suspicion
of the Irish people which was entertained by the Tories&mdash;and
Mr. Gladstone, entering from behind the Speaker's chair
at that very moment, just caught that one phrase. It was
impossible for him to hear more than that one word &quot;suspicion&quot;;
but at that word he pricked up his ears, and while
he was still walking to his place&mdash;before he had seated himself&mdash;&quot;Hear,
hear,&quot; he cried. His eagerness would not let
him wait till he had taken his seat. His absolute absorption
in the Bill before the House was so complete that, as he
walked to his seat, you could see the rapt and concentrated
look, which showed that, even during the few minutes he had
been away, the brain had never left for one second its
absorbing theme.</p>

<div class="sn">The consolations
of
old age.</div>

<p>But&mdash;as I have indicated&mdash;this complete subjugation of
temper which Mr. Gladstone has achieved, has
its disadvantages when such a conflict is provoked
as that with Mr. Chamberlain on the article in
the <i>Daily News</i>. Mr. Gladstone himself spoke of the consolations
of old age; there is one consolation he did not
mention. His absorption in the Bill and the slight deafness
in one of his ears do not allow him to perceive so plainly
<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" class="pagenum" title="Page 193"></a>
the rude noises and interruptions by which he is often
assailed from the Tory Benches. Moreover, the native
chivalry of his disposition, the curious simplicity which has
remained his central characteristic, in spite of all the
experiences of the baser side of human nature which must
have been crowded into all that half a century of official and
Parliamentary life&mdash;that unwillingness to see anything but
deplorable error in his most rancorous, meanest, and most
malignant opponent&mdash;all these things make it difficult for him
to understand the ugly realities whose serpent heads show
themselves plainly to almost every other eye but his.</p>

<p>There is a dispute among the authorities as to the incidents
of that Thursday night&mdash;some, even among
those friendly to the Prime Minister, declaring
that there was nothing unusual in the interruptions of that
night. My own recollection is clear that there was a great
deal of noise, and that it was so bad that Mr. Chamberlain
tried to explain it away, and was careful to absolve himself
and his friends from all responsibility for it. In the general
body of the Liberal party there is no doubt whatsoever
about that business. Liberal after Liberal came up to
me afterwards, in allusion to a few remarks I felt it
my duty to make, to declare their entire agreement with
the view I had put forward&mdash;that the description of the
<i>Daily News</i>, though consciously and obviously written
in the vein of parody, was a fair and just description
of what had taken place. Sir Henry Roscoe is not an
excitable politician, though no man holds to the Liberal
faith more firmly. He was met on the following Sunday
by a friend, and when asked how he viewed the situation,
declared that he was rather &quot;low!&quot; Why? he was
asked. Because his heart was saddened and enraged by the
treatment of the splendid Old Man by Mr. Chamberlain and
the Tories. To a leading Liberal Minister, two Tories privately
declared that their pain and shame and disgust with
the conduct of their own side to Mr. Gladstone was so
<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" class="pagenum" title="Page 194"></a>
profound, that they had to get up and leave the House to
control their feelings.</p>

<div class="sn">A complex
situation.</div>

<p>When, therefore, Mr. Chamberlain came forward with his
audacious complaint, this was the curious situation:
that the bulk of the Liberal party, and
many even of their opponents, were convinced
that the comments of the <i>Daily News</i> were more than justified.
The frantic cheers with which each successive sentence of the
scathing attack in the description was punctuated by the
Liberal and Irish Benches, as Joe, with affected horror, read
them out, sufficiently indicated what they thought. And, on
the other hand, the man in whose defence this reply to his
assailants was made was just as convinced that his enemies
had been unjustly assailed, and that he himself had been well
and courteously treated. In such a situation it was just possible
that Mr. Chamberlain would escape from his position
with flying colours; would have the <i>Daily News</i> censured for
falsehood by a House of Commons that believed in its truth;
and have himself declared chivalrous by a Parliament that
knows him to be malignant, unscrupulous, and merciless. To
prevent such a catastrophe it was a painful but necessary duty
to bring out the realities of the case; and not only a painful
but also a thankless duty in face of what everybody knew
would be the attitude of Mr. Gladstone himself.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Gladstone
shakes
his head.</div>

<p>For Mr. Gladstone did not delay long in indicating to the
House what his attitude would be. When I
was speaking and denouncing the rude interruptions
of the eventful Thursday night, he
shook his head ominously and in contradiction&mdash;though
manifestations which came from Liberal and Irish Benches
showed that he stood alone in his view of the events
of that night. And it was no surprise to the House, therefore,
when he stood up and said that he entirely disclaimed
any feeling of resentment for anything that had been done to
him, and that he confessed he had not perceived the interruptions
to which the report of the <i>Daily News</i> had called
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" class="pagenum" title="Page 195"></a>
attention. After this, there seemed no more to be said; but
the battle was not yet over. The Tories had been charged
both by the <i>Daily News</i> and by a speech in the House with
want of courtesy to Mr. Gladstone. Nobody knew better than
Mr. Balfour how much ground there was for such a charge;
for often in the course of the present Session&mdash;with a dark
frown on his face, with an almost violent gesture&mdash;he has
called on his unruly followers behind him to conduct themselves.
The effect of what had taken place was to extort from
Mr. Balfour a tribute to the universal respect in which the
Prime Minister was held&mdash;a tribute which the splendid Old
Man acknowledged by a low bow; and, in short, the Tories
had to bind themselves over to keep the peace by their professions
of a chivalrous desire to respect the person and the
feelings of the great Prime Minister. And thus it was
that it ended for the moment in a drawn battle&mdash;Mr.
Chamberlain having to withdraw his motion, and I my
amendment.</p>

<div class="sn">Slow
progress.</div>

<p>But in the meantime the progress with the Bill was
terribly slow. We were now on the second week
with the third clause. Amendments were disposed
of one night only to find that the next day
the number of amendments, instead of being diminished, had
been increased. It would be a sheer waste of time and
space to go into detail about these amendments. The third
clause is the clause which deals with the questions that are
to be excluded from the Irish Parliament. The list is
sufficiently long&mdash;peace and war&mdash;the Crown&mdash;the Lord-Lieutenancy&mdash;trade
and commerce&mdash;the coinage and the
currency&mdash;copyright and navigation&mdash;treason and treason
felony. But even this list was not sufficiently long for the
Unionists. They propose to increase this list of exemptions
until, if they succeeded, the Irish Legislature would have to
shut up shop for want of business to attend to. One man
gravely proposed that the Irish executive&mdash;being made
responsible for the peace, order, and good Government of
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" class="pagenum" title="Page 196"></a>
Ireland&mdash;should not have the right to settle the procedure in
the Irish criminal courts. Another gentleman proposed that
all cases referring to criminal conspiracy should be left to
the Imperial Government and Parliament. The meaning of
all this was that the Unionists wanted to draw a ring fence
around the Orangemen of Ulster, who had been threatening
rebellion. First, by one set of amendments the Irish
Government was not to have a police able to put them down,
and then the Irish courts were not to be able to convict
them when they broke the law.</p>

<div class="sn">The hours of
labour.</div>

<p>On June 9th the Unionists were on another line. They
professed to think that if the Irish Legislature
were not compelled to do so they would not prevent
overwork and long hours. This led to the
proposal that all legislation on hours of labour should be
taken out of the hands of the Irish Parliament. Mr. Chamberlain
argued this with his tongue in his cheek&mdash;professing
to dread the unequal competition in which poor England
would be placed if wealthy Ireland were allowed to compete
unfairly by longer hours. He urged this in a speech directed
to every absurd prejudice and alarm which the ignorant or
the timid could feel&mdash;altogether made a most unworthy contribution.
John Burns&mdash;breezy, outspoken&mdash;not friendly to
all things done by the Liberals in the past, but firm in his
Home Rule faith&mdash;went for Mr. Chamberlain in good, honest,
sledge-hammer, and workmanlike fashion. The member for
Battersea even dared to blaspheme Birmingham&mdash;the Mecca
of the industrial world&mdash;for its notoriously bad record in
industrial matters&mdash;an attack which Joe seemed in no way to
relish. And all the time the Old Man&mdash;with his hand to his
ear, and sitting on the very end of the Treasury Bench, so as
to be nearer the speaker&mdash;listened attentively, sympathetically,
occasionally uttering that fine leonine cheer of his. It
was on this amendment that the Ministerial majority fell,
owing to various accidents, to 30, and the Tories cheered
themselves into a happy condition of mind for a few minutes.</p>

<div><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197" class="pagenum" title="Page 197"></a></div>
<div class="sn">The guillotine&mdash;but
not yet.</div>

<p>Towards the end of the sitting there was a certain feverishness
of expectation. Dr. McGregor, a Scotch
Highland member, had announced that at half-past
six he would move the closure of the third
clause&mdash;on which we had now been working for a fortnight.
But Mr. Mellor refused to put such a drastic proposal on the
suggestion of a private member. There was, however, a
very plain intimation that if a Minister were to make such
a proposal it might be considered differently; all of which
meant that we were approaching&mdash;slowly, patiently, forbearingly&mdash;but
still approaching the moment when drastic steps
would be taken to accelerate progress.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII" />CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>THE SEXTON INCIDENT.</h3>


<div class="sn">Mr. Sexton.</div>

<p>The resignation of Mr. Sexton, early in June, seemed to
point to one of those disastrous splits in the Irish
ranks which have always come at the wrong
moment to spoil the chances of the Irish cause. There were
many whose memories were brought back by the event to
that trying and strange time when Mr. Parnell fought his
desperate battle for the continuance of his leadership. But
then there were many modifications of the position, and the
chief of these was the much greater tranquillity with which
the affair was regarded; and the general faith that the Irish
members would be wise enough to settle their differences
satisfactorily. Still there were some very ugly moments.</p>

<div class="sn">A Conservative
opportunity.</div>

<p>Nothing could be more galling, for instance, to those who
had charge of the Home Rule Bill, than to look
across at the Irish Benches and see a vast and
aching void in the places where the representatives
of the people mainly concerned are accustomed to sit.
The Tories were not slow to utilise the moment; and if things
had been different&mdash;if the Home Rule cause had not got so
far&mdash;they would probably have been able to stop progress
with the measure altogether. But fortunately the Home
Rule Bill was in committee&mdash;and whether men like it or not,
it is impossible for them to avoid something like business
discussion when a Bill is in committee. There is the clause
<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199" class="pagenum" title="Page 199"></a>
under discussion; there are the amendments to it, which
stand on the paper; the clause and the amendments have to
be spoken to; and it is impossible, within the limits of a
discussion so defined, to introduce a subject so extraneous as
a domestic difficulty in the Irish ranks. But, at the same
time, the opportunity was too tempting to be altogether
passed without notice. Sir John Lubbock has taken a prominent
part at times in opposing the Home Rule Bill. Sir
John is a most estimable man, has written some very entertaining
books, and in the City has appropriate rank as both
an erudite and a rich banker. But he does not shine in the
House of Commons. His voice is thin and feeble, and his
arguments, somehow or other, always appear wire-drawn.
And then the House of Commons is a place, above all others,
where physical qualities go largely towards making success
or failure. A robustious voice and manner are the very first
essentials of Parliamentary success; and no man who is not
gifted with these things has really much right to try Parliamentary
life. However, Sir John Lubbock was not strong
enough to withstand the temptation of making capital out of
Irish misfortunes; and he pointed to the Irish Benches, with
their yawning emptiness, as a proof that the Irish members
took no interest whatsoever in the Home Bale Bill.</p>

<div class="sn">Irish
objections
to divorce.</div>

<p>Meantime, in the House itself the Home Rule Bill was
crawling slowly along. The Unionists were at
their sinister work of delaying its progress by all
kinds of absurd and irrelevant amendments. For
instance, one Unionist wished to restrict the Irish Legislature
as to the law of marriage and divorce. Mr. Gladstone has
over and over again pointed out that, as the Irish have one
way of looking at these things, and the English another, it
would be absurd not to allow the Irish Legislature to settle
such a matter in accordance with Irish feeling. Curiously
enough, the Unionists did not receive much encouragement
on this point from the Irish branch of the enemies of Home
Rule. Mr. Macartney, an Irish Orangeman, proclaimed on
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200" class="pagenum" title="Page 200"></a>
the part of his co-religionists that the Irish Protestants had
nearly as much objection to divorce as the Irish Catholics;
and, so far as that part of the amendment was concerned, he
had no desire to see it pressed. What he apprehended was a
change in the law for the purpose of prejudicing mixed
marriages&mdash;marriages between Catholics and Protestants.
Mr. Gladstone, it is well known, on the question of divorce
is a very sound and very strong Conservative. The sturdy
fight he made against divorce still lives in Parliamentary
history, and has often been brought up&mdash;sometimes in justification
of equally stubborn fights&mdash;against him. It is one of
the points on which he does not seem to have much modified
his opinions, in spite of the advance of time, and all that has
taken place in the long stretch of years between now and the
day when an unbelieving and pagan minister like Lord
Palmerston enabled men and women to get rid of adulterous
spouses. But Mr. Gladstone declined to be drawn.</p>

<div class="sn">Disestablishment.</div>

<p>On June 18th, Mr. Bartley proposed an amendment to a
restriction in the Bill with regard to the establishment
and endowment of any church. By the
Bill&mdash;as is pretty well known&mdash;the Irish Parliament
are forbidden to confer on any church the privilege of
State establishment and State endowment. To this restriction
no Irish member has ever raised the least objection. It was
reserved for Mr. Bartley&mdash;one of the most vehement opponents
of Irish nationality and an Irish Parliament&mdash;to declare
that such a restriction would make the Parliament unworthy
of the acceptance of a nation of freemen, and to propose
that accordingly it should be removed. The position, then,
in which the Irish opponents of the Bill were placed, was
this&mdash;that while denouncing the supremacy and encroachments
of the Catholic Church as one of the main objections
against the Bill, they proposed that the Irish Parliament
should have the right to establish and endow that very
Church. Mr. Balfour perceived&mdash;under the light thus borne
in upon him&mdash;that this was not an amendment which the
<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201" class="pagenum" title="Page 201"></a>
Tory party could safely support; and he accordingly advised
Mr. Bartley to withdraw it. Mr. Gladstone made a few
scornful observations; and, without a division, the proposal
was huddled out of sight. It was almost a pity. It would
have been such an instructive spectacle to see the whole
Tory party voting that the Catholic Church in Ireland
should have the right to be endowed and established; and
some of the Irish members felt this so much, that they were
very much inclined to force the Tories to a division. But
they let the incident pass.</p>

<div class="sn">The triumph
of the tweed
coat.</div>

<p>It is one of the curious things about Parliamentary life
in England, that the smallest detail of personal
habit attracts the all-searching gaze of the entire
world. Let a man change the shape of his hat,
the colour of his clothes, the style even of his stockings,
and the world knows it all before almost he is himself conscious
of the change. And then, though the House of
Commons consists for the most part of men well advanced
in middle life&mdash;men who have made their pile in counting-house
or shop, before devoting themselves to a Parliamentary
career&mdash;it is also a House where wealth and fashion are very
largely represented. It is often a very well-dressed body;
and in this House of Commons, in particular, there is a very
large proportion of well-tailored and well-groomed young
men&mdash;especially, of course, on the Tory side. The consequence
is, that you are able to trace the transformations of
fashion, the processions of the seasons, the variety of appropriate
garbs which social and other engagements impose, as
accurately in the House of Commons as in Rotten Row.</p>

<div class="sn">The old
order.</div>

<p>The ordinary tendency of the Parliamentary man is
towards the sombre black, and the solemnity of
the long-tailed frock-coat. There have been times
when if a member of Parliament did venture to
enter the House of Commons in a coat prematurely ending
in the short tails of the morning coat, or in the tail-less
sack-coat, he would have been called up to the Speaker's
<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202" class="pagenum" title="Page 202"></a>
chair and as severely reprimanded as though he had committed
the most atrocious offence&mdash;in those far-off days&mdash;of
wearing a pot-hat. But in these democratic times one
can do anything; and low-crowned hats, sack-coats, homespun
Irish tweeds, affright and shock the old aristocratic
Parliamentary eye. When summer approaches, the whole
aspect of the House changes. The sombre black is almost
entirely doffed; and you look on an assembly as different in
its outward appearance from its antecedent state as the
yellow-winged butterfly is from the grim grub. Indeed,
members of Parliament seem to take a delight in anticipating
the change of dress which the change of season imposes.
There are members of the House of Commons who can
claim to wear the very first white hat of the season. Sir
Wilfrid Lawson has a sombre creed and a Bacchanalian
spirit; and, accordingly, the very first time a mere stray
gleam of sunshine streaks the wintry gloom Sir Wilfrid wears
an audaciously white hat.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Gladstone's
rejuvenescence.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone is a curious mixture of splendour and carelessness.
He nearly always wears a small,
narrow black tie, which brings into greater relief
the Alpine heights and the measureless width of
his big shirt-collars, and the broad expanse of his shirt-front.
But this tie&mdash;though it marks a pleasant and becoming individuality
of dress&mdash;loses half its effect by nearly always
getting out of its place; when night is advanced, the knot is
always about half across Mr. Gladstone's neck. On the other
hand, he is nearly always very carefully dressed; his black
frock-coat&mdash;a little ancient in make, and always of the smooth
black, which has given way with younger men to the diagonals&mdash;is
a well-known feature of every great debate, and adds
grace to his appearance and delivery. When summer comes,
however, he bursts into an almost dazzling glory of white
waistcoats, grey cashmere coats, and hats of creamy-yellow
whiteness, ethereal and almost aggressively summery. The
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203" class="pagenum" title="Page 203"></a>
younger men are not slow to follow so excellent an example&mdash;though
generally there is the tendency to the dark grey,
which is a compromise between the black of winter and the
fiery white tweed which the man in the street is wont to
wear. Sir Charles Russell&mdash;who, returning from Paris on the
same day as Mr. Sexton, received a very warm welcome&mdash;is
also a child of his age in his clothes. Time was when a great
legal luminary&mdash;especially if he were on the bench&mdash;was
supposed to be violating every canon of good taste if he did not
wear garments which might be described as a cross between
the garb of a bishop, an undertaker, and a hangman. The
judge on the bench, in fact, was always supposed to be putting
on the black cap figuratively, and, therefore, was obliged to
bear with him the outward sign of his damnable trade. The
late Lord Cairns was the first to break through this tradition,
and affect the style of the prosperous stockbroker. Sir
Charles Russell is different, for he dresses in thorough taste;
but when one saw him in the House of Commons in a grey
suit and a deep-cut waistcoat, one might have taken him for
a gentleman squire with a taste for study, varied by an
occasional visit to Newmarket.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Morley's
tweed suit.</div>

<p>All these observations have been suggested by the portentous
fact that on June 15th Mr. John Morley
startled the world of Parliament by appearing in
a very neat, a very well cut, and a very light
tweed suit. If Mr. Morley figures in many Tory imaginations
as a modern St. Just, longing for the music of the
guillotine and the daily splash of Tory and orthodox blood, it
is much more due to his clothes than to his writings; for
ordinarily he is dressed after the fashion which one can well
suppose reigned in the days when the men of the Terror were
inaugurating a reign of universal love, brotherhood, and peace
through the narrow opening between the upper and the lower
knife of the guillotine. His coat is blue: so is his waistcoat;
and his nether garments are of a severe drab brown. It is
impossible to imagine that any man who assumes such
garments could be otherwise than a severe and sanguinary
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204" class="pagenum" title="Page 204"></a>
doctrinaire, anxious for his neighbours' blood. The genial
smile with which the House of Commons has become familiar
has invalidated the Tory estimate of Mr. Morley, but it was
that memorable Thursday that completed the transformation
of judgment. No man could be a lover of the guillotine who
could wear so airy, so gay, and, above all, so juvenile and
well-cut a suit of clothes. Mr. Morley himself was overwhelmed
with the amount of attention which his new suit
attracted. He, poor man, did not see the portentous political
significance of the transaction, and almost sank under the
multitude and variety of congratulations which he received
from watchful friends. He has done many great and successful
things in the course of his brilliant career&mdash;but he
never achieved a triumph so complete and so prompt as he
did when he put on his light tweed suit, and steered under its
illuminating rays the Home Rule Bill through the rocks and
shoals, the eddies and the cross-currents of the House of
Commons.</p>

<div class="sn">A brilliant
pas de deux.</div>

<p>On the following afternoon there was another scene in
which clothes had their share. At about three
o'clock there entered the House together two
slight, alert figures&mdash;in both cases a little above
the middle height, and both clothed in a suit of clothes the
exact counterpart of each other in make, shape, and colour.
There was a dominant and almost monotonous grey in their
appearance; but there was little of grey in their looks.
When at once there burst from the Tory and Unionists
Benches a loud, wild, prolonged huzzah, it was seen that this
theatrical little entrance at one and the same time of Joe and
Mr. Balfour, was their method of accentuating the Tory
triumph in Linlithgow. The two gentlemen seen entering
together separated as they walked up the floor&mdash;the Tory
going to his place on the front Opposition Bench, the
Unionist to his corner seat on the Liberal side. It was a
very skilfully arranged bit of business, though there were
critics who thought its histrionic element a little out of place
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205" class="pagenum" title="Page 205"></a>
in the sombre and solemn realities of public life, and a great
national controversy. In the midst of it all I looked at
Mr. Gladstone. It is in such moments that you are able to
get a glimpse into all the great depths of this extraordinary
nature. And I have written more than once in these columns
that the greatest of all his characteristics is composure.
This mighty, restless, fiery fighter against wrong&mdash;this
stalwart and unconquerable wrestler for right, this Titan&mdash;I
might even say this Don Quixote&mdash;who has gone out with
spear and sword to assault the most strongly-entrenched
citadels of human wrongs&mdash;who has faced a world in arms&mdash;this
man has, after all, at the centre of his existence, and in
the depths of his nature, a gospel which sustains him in the
hours of defeat and gloom, and makes him one of the most
restless of combatants, and the most tranquil.</p>

<div class="sn">The grand
old philosopher.</div>

<p>Devotional, almost pietistic, introspective, accustomed, I
have no doubt, from that early training of
domestic piety and sacerdotal surroundings, to
see all this gay, vast phantasmagoria of life the
antechamber to a greater, more enduring, and better world
beyond those voices, Mr. Gladstone&mdash;at least that is my reading
of his character&mdash;looks at everything in human existence
with the power of self-detachment from its garish moments and
its transient interests. Behind this constant warfare, underneath
all this public passion and sweeping resolves, there is a
nether and unseen world of thought, emotion, hope, and in
that world there is ever calm. It is a tabernacle in his soul
where only holy thoughts may enter. Outside its impenetrable
and echoless walls are left behind the shouts of faction,
the noise of battle, the rise and fall of the good and ever-enduring
fight between wrong and right. Within that tabernacle
Mr. Gladstone has the power of withdrawing himself at will,
just as in the Agora of Athens, and on the last great day when
he discoursed on immortality, and drank the mortal hemlock,
Socrates could withdraw himself, and listen to the inner
whisper of his d&aelig;mon. All this, I say, you could see in the
<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206" class="pagenum" title="Page 206"></a>
abstracted, resigned and composed look of Mr. Gladstone at
the moment when his triumphant enemies, in their summer
garb, with their smiling faces, and strutting walk, entered the
House of Commons. If you wanted to see at once the contrast,
not only of the temper of the hour, but the still greater
and more momentous contrast of temperaments, you had
only to look from the face of Mr. Gladstone to that of Mr.
Chamberlain. The contrast of their years&mdash;the deeper contrast
of their natures&mdash;above all, the profounder contrast of
their worlds of thought, training and environment&mdash;all were
brought out. In that perky, retrouss&eacute;-nosed, self-complacent,
confidently smiling man you saw all the flippancy&mdash;so-called
realism&mdash;the petty commercialism of the end of the middle
of the nineteenth century. The mysticism, the poetry, the
rich devotion, the lofty and large ideals of the beginning of
the century&mdash;of the time that remembered Byron and produced
Newman&mdash;all these things were to be seen in the rapt
look of that noble, beautiful and refined face on the Treasury
Bench. And yet there was something more. The brilliant
light of the early days of our century has become dim and
cold in those hearts and minds which have not had the power
to grow and expand with their ages. But with that splendid
sanity of body as well as mind which belongs to him, Mr.
Gladstone is the creature of the ending of the nineteenth as
of the beginning of the twentieth century. Like the man of
Arctic climes, he stands almost at the same moment in the
sunset of one great century and the heralding light of the
sunrise of another.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV" />CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>THE BURSTING OF THE STORM.</h3>


<div class="sn">An Indian
summer.</div>

<p>There is a striking description in one of Mr. Rudyard Kipling's
stories of a night in an Indian city when
the dog star rages. Luridly, but vigorously, the
author brings home to you the odious discomfort,
the awful suffering, and, finally, the morose anger and almost
homicidal fury, which the sweltering light produces in the
waking soldiers. This would have been something like the
temper of the House of Commons on June 18th, if that
assembly had not recently discovered methods of saving its
temper and pleasantly spending its vacant hours. For the
dog star&mdash;raging, merciless, sweltering&mdash;ruled everywhere
within Westminster Palace. On the floor of the House itself,
men sweltered and mopped their foreheads; in even the
recesses of the still library they groaned aloud; then down
on the Terrace, and with the river sweeping by, there was
not a particle of air; and the heat of all the day had made
even the stony floor of that beautiful walk almost like the
tiles of a red-hot oven. In short, it was a day when one
felt one's own poor tenement of clay a misery, a nuisance,
and a burden; and the mind, morose, black, and despondent,
had distracting visions of distant mirages by the seashore or
under green trees. It was natural, under such circumstances,
that everybody who could should desert the House of Commons.
And this sudden desertion of the House will be
<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208" class="pagenum" title="Page 208"></a>
always remembered as one of the many peculiarities of the
Annus Mirabilis through which we are passing. It has not
been unusual for some years for members to take a turn on
the Terrace now and then. I have paced its floor at every
hour of the night and the day&mdash;from the still midnight to
the delightful moments before breaking day; and I still
remember the beautiful summery morning when, after a hard
night's fight, an Irish member rushed down to the Terrace
to tell Mr. Sexton and myself that we were just being suspended&mdash;an
operation not yet grown customary. But this
Session the majority of the House of Commons is always on the
Terrace; and woman&mdash;that sleuth-hound of every new pleasure&mdash;has
discovered this great fact, and utilised it accordingly.</p>

<div class="sn">Tea on the
Terrace.</div>

<p>The afternoon tea&mdash;the strawberries and cream which
make a coolness and delight in the midst of the
raging day&mdash;has been erected by woman into one
of London's daily social events; and though the
novelist has not discovered the fact up to this moment&mdash;Mr.
McCarthy has made a very pretty love scene on the Terrace,
but it is at the witching hour of night&mdash;though this discovery
has yet to come, the respite is brief, and in a short time we
shall have the hero and the heroine passing through all the
agonies of three-volume suffering, to the accompaniment of
the division bell and the small tea-table of the Terrace. But
though woman has many slaves she has her watchful
enemies. The great order of curmudgeon is wide and vigilant
and crusty, and the curmudgeon has found that the vast
crowds of ladies who have invaded the Terrace have at last
begun to interfere with that daily constitutional along its
stretching length, which is the only exercise most members
of Parliament are able to take in these fierce days. Accordingly,
there appeared an ominous notice-board with the words,
&quot;For members only,&quot; at a particular point in the Terrace.
Within the space, before which this notice stood as a fiery
sword, woman was not allowed to intrude; and from out its
sacred enclosure&mdash;guarded by nothing but the line of the
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209" class="pagenum" title="Page 209"></a>notice and the Speaker's wrath&mdash;the confirmed bachelor, the
married cynic, smoked his cigarette, and looked lazily through
at the chattering, tea-drinking, bright-coloured crowd immediately
beyond.</p>

<div class="sn">Demos and
dinner.</div>

<p>I regret to say that the great Demos had an opportunity
of seeing the legislator at work and play, and that
the remarks of that extremely irreverent person
were not complimentary. Reading, doubtless, in
the papers something of the fatiguing labours&mdash;of the stern
attention to business&mdash;of the long and dreary hours which
the patriots of the House of Commons were devoting to the
work of the country, Demos was shocked and scandalised to
behold this giddy, fashionable, and modish crowd. Demos,
sweltering on the passing steamboat&mdash;able to see, and, at the
same time, free from interference on his watery kingdom&mdash;jeered
aloud as he passed close to the Terrace, and mocked
with loud laughter that betokened not only the vacant but the
insulting mind. The skippers of the steamboats&mdash;hardened
Cockneys with an eye to business&mdash;knew what a delight this
baiting of the august assembly would be to the most democratic
and most sarcastic crowd in Europe; and accordingly
it became the &quot;mot d'ordre&quot; with the steamboat skipper,
when the tide was full, to bring his vessel almost to
the very walls of the Terrace, and thus to give the tripper the
opportunity of gazing from very near at the lions at food and
play. If Demos could have come and seen as plainly at night in
those days as during the afternoon, his shocked feelings would
have been even more poignant and his language more irreverent.
Tea is, after all, a simple drink that makes the whole world
akin; and even strawberries in this great year were within
reach of the most modest purse. But at night, entertainment
is more costly. Along the Terrace there is now, as everybody
knows, a series of small dining-rooms; and here every night
you might have listened to the pleasant music of woman's
laughter, punctuated by the pop of the champagne bottle. Time
was&mdash;I remember it well&mdash;when a member of Parliament who
<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210" class="pagenum" title="Page 210"></a>
knew that there was any place where a lady could get something
to eat was pointed to as a Parliamentary marvel, who
knew his way about in an uncanny fashion; when the room
in which a lady could dine had been seen by but few eyes and,
indeed, was little better than a coalhole, low-roofed, dimly lit,
buried in dark and deep recesses of an underworld of the
House of Commons, as little known to the general member
as the sewage catacombs of London to the ordinary citizen.
But all this has been changed; and now the dinner to ladies
at the House of Commons has become, like the afternoon tea,
one of the best recognized of London's social festivities. And
so great is the run on these dinners that it takes a week's&mdash;or
even two weeks'&mdash;notice to secure a table. Mr. Cobbe&mdash;a
stern and unbending Radical, with a hot temper and unsparing
tongue&mdash;might have been seen one of those June
days with a menacing frown upon his rugged Radical forehead,
and by-and-bye in serious converse with the Speaker.
And the cause of his anger was that he had found all the
dining-tables ordered for two weeks ahead.</p>

<div class="sn">A wild scene.</div>

<p>Speaking on the Freemasons, on June 22nd, Mr. Gladstone
related the interesting autobiographical
fact that he himself was not a Freemason, and
never had been; and, indeed, having been fully occupied
otherwise&mdash;this delicate allusion to that vast life of never-ending
work&mdash;of gigantic enterprises&mdash;of solemn and
sublime responsibilities, was much relished&mdash;he never had
had sufficient curiosity to make any particular inquiries as
to what Freemasonry really was. I don't know what came
over Mr. Balfour&mdash;some people thought it was because he
expected to detach some Freemason votes from the Liberal
side; but he was guilty of what I admit is an unusual thing
with him&mdash;an intentional, a gross, an almost shameful
misrepresentation of Mr. Gladstone's words. Making the
same interesting personal statement as Mr. Gladstone, that
he was not himself a Freemason, he went on to suggest
that Mr. Gladstone had made a comparison between a
<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211" class="pagenum" title="Page 211"></a>
fraudulent Liberator Society and the Freemasons. At this
thrust there was a terrible hubbub in the House, and that
fanaticism with which the Mason holds to his institution
was aroused; indeed, for a little while, the scene was
Bedlam-like in its passion and anarchy. In the midst of
it all, facing the violent howls of the excited Tories, pale,
disturbed, hotly angry underneath all the composure of
language and tone, Mr. Gladstone exposed the shameful and
entirely groundless misrepresentation. Mr. Balfour's better
angel intervened; he got ashamed of himself, and at once
apologized. But the hurricane of passion which had been
let loose was not to be so easily appeased; and when,
presently, Mr. John Morley put an end to the ridiculous
and irrelevant discussion which threatened to land the
House of Commons into the consideration of the arcana of
a Freemason's Lodge, there burst from the Tory benches
one of the fiercest little storms of remonstrance I have ever
heard. When the closure is proposed, there is but one way
of expressing emotion. Under the rules of the House, the
motion must be put without debate. So when the word of
doom is pronounced by the Minister, all that remains is for
the Speaker or Chairman to refuse or accept the motion;
and if he accept the motion, he simply rises, and, uttering
the fateful words, &quot;The question is that the motion be now
put,&quot; guillotines all further speech. But then he has to put
the question, and in the answering words of &quot;Aye&quot; or
&quot;No,&quot; there can be put an immense fund of passion. So
it was that night. The answering &quot;Noes&quot; reached the
proportions of a cyclone; you could see men shrieking out
the word again and again, almost beside themselves with
rage, and with faces positively distorted by the intensity of
their feelings. And the tempest did not end in a moment;
again and again the Tories shouted their hoarse and
tempestuous, and angry &quot;No, no!&quot;&mdash;the word sometimes
repeated like a volley: &quot;No, no-o-o, no-o-o-o-o!&quot;&mdash;this
was the noise that rose on the Parliamentary air,
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212" class="pagenum" title="Page 212"></a>
and that gave vent to all the passion which had been excited.
And then came the division and a restoration of calm.</p>

<div class="sn">Charwomen
and ratcatchers.</div>

<p>The Whip is a cunning dog, especially if he be the Whip
of the party in power; and you have to be a
long time in Parliament before you know all his
wiles, and fully appreciate their meaning. For
instance, few innocent outsiders would understand why it
is that the Whip always puts down Estimates for a day
immediately after the end of a vacation. The reasons are
two. First, because Estimates give more time and opportunity
for the mere bore and obstructive than any other part
of Parliamentary business. On the Estimates, as I have
often explained, every single penny spent in the public
service has to be entered. Whether that sum be large or
small makes no difference. For instance, there is a charwoman
at the Foreign Office; the charwoman's salary
appears in the accounts just as bold and just as plain as the
five thousand a year which the country has to pay for Lord
Rosebery&mdash;who is cheap at the money, I must say, lest I
be misunderstood. There is associated with Buckingham
Palace a most worthy and useful individual called the ratcatcher.
Everybody can see why in such a vast and generally
untenanted barrack, there should be a ratcatcher. Well,
Master Ratcatcher appears on the Estimates for Buckingham
Palace just as regularly, as plainly, in as much
detail, as my Lord High Chamberlain, Lord Carrington.
There is no reason whatever why a whole evening should
not be spent in the discussion of the ratcatcher's salary.
Perhaps the reader may have heard that, in common with
many sobered and middle-aged gentlemen, I have had a pre-historic
period when I was accused&mdash;of course, unjustly&mdash;of
interfering with the progress of public business. In that period,
I remember very well, the ratcatcher of Buckingham Palace
loomed largely, as well as many other strange and portentous
figures now vanished into the void and the immensities. I
don't know whether we were able to keep the Ministry going
<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213" class="pagenum" title="Page 213"></a>
for a whole night on the subject or not; but still we managed
to get some excellent change out of the business.</p>

<div class="sn">The wistful
Whip.</div>

<p>This brief explanation will make the reader understand
what it is you can do on the Estimates, and
therefore bring home to your mind the wile of
the Ministerial Whip. For his second reason for
putting down the Estimates until after vacation is, that he
knows there will be a very small attendance of members, and
that thus he will be able to sneak through his Estimates more
quickly than usual. When, therefore, you hear of a vacation
in the House of Commons, you will always find that the
members ask with peculiar anxiety what is to be the first
business on the day on which the vacation concludes; and you
will hear the audible sigh of relief which will rise from hundreds
of oppressed bosoms when the Leader of the House for
the time being announces that it will be Estimates. Members
then know that they need be in no violent hurry to get
back, and that things will go right, even though they should
tarry that additional day, or even two days, longer by the sad
sea waves or amid the tall grass.</p>

<div class="sn">To thy
orisons.</div>

<p>It is one of the peculiarities of the House of Commons that
the men who are most in want of spiritual assistance
and providential guidance, never seek the
assistance of prayer. However terrible the crisis,
however crowded every other inch of space in the House of
Commons may be, though the ungodliest member may be in
his place listening to the rich resonance of Archdeacon
Farrar's voice, the Treasury Bench is always empty. To an
outsider the explanation may be here revealed; which is, that
if you attend prayers you are entitled to a seat for the
remainder of the evening, whereas if you are absent, you are
liable at any moment to be turned out by your more pious
brother. But Ministers are exempt from this general law,
for their places are fixed for them on the Treasury Bench,
whatever may happen, and, accordingly, they invariably&mdash;I
had almost said religiously&mdash;keep away from prayers. Lest I
<a name="Page_214" id="Page_214" class="pagenum" title="Page 214"></a>
should appear to do injustice, I may say that the leaders of the
Opposition are just as ungodly, and for precisely the same
reason; their seats also are secured to them by standing
order; and, accordingly, they also never enter the House
until its devotions for the day are over. There was just one
exception to this. For some reason best known to himself,
Sir John Gorst (he is usually at variance with his friends)
had come down early on June 28th, and was in his place with
edifying aspect to listen to the solemn exhortation and the
soft responses.</p>

<div class="sn">The shout
of battle.</div>

<p>At twenty minutes past twelve there is a roar in the
House; the Old Man has arrived; and there
ascends that bracing cheer with which in our still
barbarous times we welcome our champions on the
eve of a big fight. The Old Man has hurried, for he is out of
breath; and the deadly pallor of his cheek is almost affrighting
to see. But he soon recovers himself, though when he rises
to speak the breathlessness is still very apparent, and he has
to gasp almost now and then for more voice. Fortunately on
this occasion we have not long to wait for the big announcement
which everybody is so anxiously expecting. It is usually
the fate of the House of Commons, whenever something very
momentous is under weigh, to have a thousand trivialities in
its path before it gets on to the real business. I have heard
something like a hundred questions asked, most of them very
trivial, on more than one night, when the whole of the civilized
world was waiting for the Minister to develop some great
plan of Governmental policy. The bore, the faddist, the
empty self-advertiser, is as inevitable on such occasions as
the reportorial dog that always rushes along the Derby course
at that dread moment when you can hear the beating of the
gamblers' hearts.</p>

<div class="sn">To business.</div>

<p>But on this fateful Wednesday there is no such ridiculous
intervention. There are only two questions altogether
on the paper; and both of those refer to the
great issue of how obstruction is to be put down. Mr.
Glad<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215" class="pagenum" title="Page 215"></a>stone
answers the questions very briefly; but there is hidden
and fateful meaning in every syllable he utters; and the
House of Commons, looking on, shows itself in one of those
moments which bring out all its picturesqueness&mdash;its latent
passions&mdash;its very human characteristics. There is the eager
strain of curiosity. Every face is turned to that of the single
pale white solitary figure that stands out from the Treasury
Bench, dressed, I may add, in the sober but light grey suit of the
summer season, in spite of his being a messenger of such doom
to Tory obstruction. There is a hush, but a hush never lasts
long in the House of Commons when a great party blow is
going to be struck. The nerves of the House, raised to
expectancy&mdash;tension, almost hysteria, by the joy of the one
side, the anger and dread of the other, have a preternatural
readiness in catching points, in producing outbursts of feeling.
And so it is to-day. The Prime Minister has scarcely uttered
the words which reveal the determination of the Government
to resort to the most extreme measures, when there burst
simultaneously from the Irish and the Tory Benches cheers
and counter cheers&mdash;the cheer of pride, joy, and delirium
almost, in the one case; the answering cheer and counter
cheer of haughty and angered defiance in the other.</p>

<div class="sn">Balfour the
unready.</div>

<p>The Old Man bears himself splendidly amidst all this. He
is very excited and very resolute&mdash;you can see
that by the very deadliness of tranquillity
which he seeks to put in his voice, by the
gentleness of his tone, by the almost deprecatory smile.
All the same, the prevalent note of his voice and manner
is composure. For the moment, either from surprise,
relief, the joy they can badly conceal&mdash;whatever the reason,
the Tories seem to be nonplussed. The audacious ally who
is always ready to rush rashly into the breach on such occasions
is away in Birmingham; and with all his excellent
qualities, Mr. Balfour is not remarkable for readiness.
Accordingly there is an awkward pause, and no one rises from
the Opposition Benches. This is serious, for first blood tells
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216" class="pagenum" title="Page 216"></a>
in Parliamentary as in other prize fights. The Old Man,
however, is all alive. He passes on from this mighty announcement
as though he had said nothing in particular, and taking
a bundle of notes&mdash;put together with characteristic care and
neatness even in the very centre of all this storm&mdash;he proceeds
to tell Mr. Goschen something about the currency
question, and the state of the silver market in India. The
currency&mdash;who cares about the currency now? Even the
hardiest bimetallist cannot be got to think of his hobby in
the face of the dread news just heard. By the time Mr.
Gladstone has given his answers, Mr. Balfour has managed
to slightly recover himself, and has framed a question to the
Old Man.</p>

<div class="sn">The precedent
of 1887.</div>

<p>When at last the question does come, it is of a very
innocent character. The Old Man has declared
that he had not the terms of the resolution ready,
but that they would be announced to the House
before its rising in the evening. All Mr. Balfour wishes to
know is, what time it will be when these terms are given.
Such is the simple question; but the reply is of a very
different character. It was delivered in studiously moderate
terms; the voice of Mr. Gladstone never rises above a
sweet coo; but there is fire, defiance, inflexible determination
in every syllable, and the first blow is struck
when the wily Old Man announces&mdash;as though it were the
merest business affair&mdash;that the closure resolution which the
Government will introduce, is founded upon the principle of
the resolution of 1887. He can go no further for several
seconds. The Irish, with their ready wits&mdash;their fierce and
keen memories&mdash;have caught the point at once; and they
burst into a cheer&mdash;loud, fierce, and prolonged. What it
means is this: In 1887, the Tories had carried a closure
resolution for the purpose of forcing through the Coercion
Bill of that year; and it was under the working of that
closure resolution that the Bill had finally passed the House
of Commons, with several of its clauses undebated. What,
<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217" class="pagenum" title="Page 217"></a>
then, this fierce Irish cheer meant was that the chickens
were coming home to roost; and that the Tories were now
reaping the harvest of their own sowing. With grave face
the Old Man waited until the storm had spent itself, and
then he went on to make a little slip, which for the moment
gave his enemies an excellent opening.</p>

<div class="sn">Revolution or
resolution.</div>

<p>He spoke not of the resolution, but of the revolution.
He corrected the slip with great rapidity, but he
was not quick enough for his watchful enemies,
and loudly&mdash;discordantly&mdash;triumphantly&mdash;they
repeated the word after him&mdash;Revolution&mdash;Revolution. However,
Mr. Gladstone, after his Socratic fashion, lowered his
eyes for a moment and went off into one of those abstract
reveries whither he always allows his fancy to wend its way
whenever his opponents are particularly rancorous. Then
he described the resolution&mdash;not the revolution&mdash;as in the
interest of the convenience and liberty of the House. But
he immediately added&mdash;with the sweetest smile&mdash;that Mr.
Balfour would doubtless form his own judgment on that
point; and then, still calm, sweet, with the tendency to the
reverie of the good man grossly misjudged by sinful opponents,
he sat him down.</p>

<div class="sn">An awkward
moment.</div>

<p>In the midst of the exultation which the announcement
of the Government had produced in the Liberal
ranks, there came a difficulty and a humiliation.
An amendment had been proposed, Mr. Gladstone
had twice opposed it, everything pointed to its ignominious
rejection, and, in view of the coming closure, everybody
seemed to want rapid despatch. And thus a division was
immediately called. The House was cleared; members
rushed in, and, indeed, had already begun to pass through
the lobby; when suddenly there was a complete change of
tactics; Mr. Marjoribanks, rushing to the Treasury Bench,
called upon the Government to capitulate. The fact got
out; the Government were in a minority&mdash;their forces had
not come in time, and the Tories would have beaten us if
<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218" class="pagenum" title="Page 218"></a>
they had been allowed to go to a division. It was one of
the narrowest shaves&mdash;one of the most uncomfortable
quarters of a minute&mdash;we have had in the House of Commons
for many a long day.</p>

<div class="sn">The fateful
moment.</div>

<p>But half-past five comes at last; then the discussion on
the Home Rule Bill has to come to an end, and
the Speaker takes the chair. Members think
there is a look of unusual excitement on his face,
that its air is angry; and the Unionists take comfort from
the idea that this step is against his judgment. But, then,
it is a matter for the House itself and not for the decision of
the chair, and so we go ahead. Mr. Morley is put up by Mr.
Gladstone to read the words of the resolution. The Old Man
himself is composedly writing that letter to the Queen which
it is still his duty daily to indite. Mr. Morley's face betrays
under all its studied calm, the excitement of the hour, and
he reads every separate announcement with a certain
dramatic emphasis that brings out all the hidden meaning;
and the document is one, the reading of which lends itself
to dramatic effect and to dramatic manifestations. For each
clause winds up with the same words, at &quot;ten of the clock,&quot;
until these words come to sound something like the burden
of a song&mdash;the refrain of a lament&mdash;the iteration of an
Athanasian curse against sinners and heretics. The House
sees all this; and each side manifests emotion according to
its fashion. The Irish cheer themselves hoarse in triumph;
the Tories answer back as defiantly and loudly; and so we
enter, with clang of battle, with shouts and cheers, and
hoarse cries of joy or of rage, into the second great pitched
battle on Home Rule.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV" />CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>MR. DILLON'S FORGETFULNESS.</h3>


<div class="sn">Mr. Dillon.</div>

<p>Everybody who has ever met Mr. Dillon knows that he has
a singularly even and equable temper, except at
the moments when he has been stung to passion
by the sight of some bitter and intolerable wrong. When,
therefore, Mr. Chamberlain made him the subject of a fierce
attack on account of a past utterance, he was dealing with a
man who was as little influenced by such attacks as anybody
could well be. For days Mr. Chamberlain had been trying
to bait Mr. Dillon into speech; and for days Mr. Dillon had
positively refused to be drawn. At last it seemed to some
friends of Mr. Dillon that if he did not speak his attitude
might be misunderstood, and that he would be supposed to
entertain, as part of a settled policy, what he had really
uttered on the spur of the moment and under the influence
of intolerable wrong and provocation. But when in the last
days of June Mr. Chamberlain made his attack, and Mr.
Dillon had listened to it and asked for dates, Mr. Dillon
thought that the matter would not be worth further
attending to, and relapsed into his old attitude of easy
contempt.</p>

<div class="sn">The outbreak.</div>

<p>This will account for what would otherwise be inexplicable;
namely, that, having had a week to prepare
his defence, Mr. Dillon should on July 3rd have
fallen into a dreadful, and, for the moment,
disastrous blunder. The truth was, Mr. Dillon had never
<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220" class="pagenum" title="Page 220"></a>
thought of the subject for more than a few moments between
the date of the challenge and Mr. Chamberlain's renewal of
the attack, and, if he had been left free to exercise his own
judgment, would have allowed the whole thing to lapse into
the nothingness into which every such charge finally falls.
On this Monday night Mr. Chamberlain was in his most
venomous mood. He had come down to the House with the
set determination to get up a row somehow or other. There
was evil in his eye; there was rancour in his voice; there
was the hoarse rage which always shows in him whenever
he feels that he has been beaten. His judgment is so shallow&mdash;his
temper so rash and violent&mdash;that some people think he
actually counted that the Government would never have
dared to interfere with his obstructive plan of campaign, and
that he would have been permitted to bury the Bill under
the vast hedge of amendments. To him, then, the strong
and drastic action of the preceding week had come as a
painful and most exasperating surprise.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe's weakness.</div>

<p>It is one of the many bad turns that Joe's temper does
him to always lead him into overdoing his part.
The wild outbursts of his venom&mdash;the ferocity
which he puts into his personal attacks&mdash;these
things have the effect of producing a certain amount of reaction;
and thus his blows often suffer from the very
violence with which they are dealt. A real master of Parliamentary
craft, like Mr. Gladstone or Mr. Sexton, has learned
the lesson&mdash;the lesson which all orators of all ages have
learned&mdash;that there is nothing so deadly as moderation;
that he destroys the effectiveness of a passion by tearing it to
pieces, and that you are really effective when you have complete
control of your temper, your voice and your language.</p>

<div class="sn">Mitchelstown.</div>

<p>Mr. Dillon, rising&mdash;pale, high-strung, and nervous&mdash;was
a sympathetic sight, and the House was ready to
listen to him with the greatest attention. The
Old Man was specially interested. Whenever
nowadays, when his hearing has become somewhat defective,
<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221" class="pagenum" title="Page 221"></a>
he wants particularly to hear a speech, he has to change his
place; usually, as everybody knows, he sits exactly opposite
the box on the Speaker's table. This evening he went to
the last seat on the Treasury Bench&mdash;the seat nearest to the
spot from which Mr. Dillon was about to speak, and with
his hand to his ear he prepared himself to catch every word
that Mr. Dillon was about to utter, and the speech of Mr.
Dillon was&mdash;in spite of the halting tones which excitement,
unpreparedness, the sense of his responsibility produced&mdash;singularly
effective. The passionate and transparent sincerity
of the man&mdash;the sense of all the years of suffering
through which he passed&mdash;the recollection of all the risks he
has run in the great contemporary Irish Revolution&mdash;all
these things spoke in his favour. Especially was he effective
when he described the circumstances under which he had
delivered the speech, a passage from which had been incriminated
by Mr. Chamberlain. He had been told just
half-an-hour before he rose to speak, of how a poor mother
had been torn from her babe; how the two had been taken
over a long journey together, and had both been finally
lodged in the same cell. And he asked with a passionate
thrill in his voice, that carried away the House with him,
whether anybody else under the same circumstances would
not have protested in language of violence and vehemence
against the cruelty and official brutality which allowed such
things to be. Would not anybody have protested that the
officials who were guilty of these things had not to look
to reward or promotion from a popular Irish Government.</p>

<div class="sn">The fatal
mistake.</div>

<p>So far, Mr. Dillon had the House completely with him.
He also scored for a second or two. He went on
to remark that he had been under the influence
of the massacre at Mitchelstown; but scarcely
had these words proceeded from his lips than a look of dismay
passed over the faces of his Irish colleagues. Close
beside him were several men who, like himself, had stood on
the platform of the historic square when the police
de<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222" class="pagenum" title="Page 222"></a>scended
upon the meeting, and which ended in the death of
three innocent men. They at once perceived that Mr.
Dillon, by some break of memory, had made a mistake in
his dates. The incriminating speech had been delivered in
December, 1886, and the Mitchelstown massacre took place in
September, 1887. If the Irish members had not perceived
this blunder immediately they would soon have been brought
to a sense of coming disaster by the movements on the
opposite side.</p>

<div class="sn">Chamberlain
on the spring.</div>

<p>Mr. T.W. Russell is always at the service of Mr. Chamberlain
at such a moment. A platform speaker
by training and by years of professional work,
accustomed to make most of his case against
Home Rule depend on the characters, the words, the acts of
the Irish members, he has, of course, at his fingers' ends, all
the useful extracts of the last thirteen years. At once he
was seen to rush excitedly from the House. Every Irishman
knew at once that he was going to the library to reinforce
his memory with regard to the date of Mitchelstown. A
murmur arose on the Irish Benches; slips of paper were
passed up to Mr. Dillon to recall to him the facts of the
case; but, either in the hurry and excitement, or because he
did not appreciate the situation immediately, Mr. Dillon went
on with his speech&mdash;unconscious of the abyss that opened up
before him. Meantime, Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;pale, excited, his
face torn with the workings of gratified hatred and coming
triumph&mdash;sat forward in his seat, his
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;eye-glass&quot; in the original text">eyeglass</ins>
shining from
afar, eagerness in every look, pose, movement.</p>

<div class="sn">Chamberlain
pounces.</div>

<p>At last Mr. Russell was back in his place; it did not
require much second sight to see that his quest
had been successful, and that he had brought to
Mr. Chamberlain the ammunition he required in
order to slay John Dillon. The moment Mr. Dillon sat down,
Mr. Chamberlain was on his feet. He worked up to the
situation with some skill; but, after all, with that overdone
passion which, as I have already said, spoils some of his
<a name="Page_223" id="Page_223" class="pagenum" title="Page 223"></a>
greatest effects&mdash;he did not expose the mistake in his first
few sentences. He worked up the agony, so to speak. First
he recalled to the Liberals&mdash;whose hatred to him he feels and
returns with interest&mdash;the fact that they had cheered Mr.
Dillon's allusion to the effect Mitchelstown had had on him in
provoking the violence of his speech. And then when he
had created his situation, he pounced down on the House
with the climax&mdash;the speech had been delivered in 1886, the
Mitchelstown tragedy had taken place in the following year.
It would be idle to deny that Mr. Chamberlain had then one
of the most triumphant moments of his life. It was a small
point, after all, and, as everybody soon knew, it was all the
result of a natural and a perfectly honest mistake. But the
House of Commons is not particular in weighing things in
judicial scales at moments of intense political passion.
There rose from the Tory and the Unionist Benches one of
the longest, fiercest, most triumphant shouts that was ever
heard in the House of Commons. But then, as I again must
say, and as will soon be seen, the passion was overdone, and
a swift retribution came by-and-bye. For the moment, however,
it was giddily, dazzlingly triumphant, and Joe had one
of the few moments of his life which were unrelieved by
disaster.</p>

<div class="sn">A diversion.</div>

<p>It was at this moment&mdash;and, curiously enough, his
victory was very soon dashed to the ground&mdash;that
Mr. Harrington, one of the Parnellites,
struck in with a blow. In Parliamentary, as in other
tactics, one of the wisest expedients&mdash;especially if things are
going rather wrong with yourself&mdash;is to carry the war into the
enemies' country. And this is exactly what Mr. Harrington
did. He turned upon Joe and denounced him for seeking at
one time to obtain the alliance of these very Irish members
whom now he was denouncing. He accused him of sending
ambassadors to them when they were in prison, and, in
short, brought Joe face to face with an almost forgotten
period of his history. Then he was almost a Home Ruler in
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224" class="pagenum" title="Page 224"></a>
profession, and looked to the Irish members as a portion of
the force he would by-and-bye marshal in his own army.</p>

<div class="sn">A quid pro
quo.</div>

<p>Joe grew pale. It is a curious fact that, whenever any
allusion is made to this special period of his life,
Mr. Chamberlain becomes particularly disturbed;
possibly, it is that he is conscious of the rash
things he has said at this period; possibly, it is that it can
be proved to the world that he was at this period in favour
of the principles and the men he now so loudly denounces.
Whatever the reason, it is perfectly certain, if you want to
put Mr. Chamberlain into a rage, and what sailors call a
funk, allude to the period of Parnell's imprisonment in
Kilmainham, and Mr. Duignan's letter on the Irish question.
The transformation from the exalted look a few moments
before to the pale, cowed aspect which Mr. Chamberlain
wore was one of the most sudden transformations I have
ever seen in the House of Commons. He could scarcely sit
in his seat while Mr. Harrington was speaking; again and
again he rose to interrupt him altogether, and gave signs of
unusual excitement and disturbance. But Mr. Harrington
is a deft and tenacious combatant. In spite of all attempts
to stop him, in spite of the tremendous uproar raised by the
Unionists and Tories, he managed to get out what he had to
say. He brought Mr. Chamberlain face to face with this
spectre of his dead past.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Balfour
does not
score.</div>

<p>Meantime, Mr. Balfour made a great mistake. He had
listened to the speech of Mr. Chamberlain, and
had been one of those who had joined in the cheers
at the exposure of Mr. Dillon's accidental mistake.
There he should have left it, but, carried away by the
hope of driving the point home against a political enemy,
he needs must add something to what Mr. Chamberlain had
said. Now Mr. Balfour is in many points very superior to
Joe. He should leave personal vituperation to him: he is
more active, defter, and more willing to do such dirty work.
Moreover, it is in the recollection of the members that, in
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225" class="pagenum" title="Page 225"></a>
the Coercionist struggle, Mr. Balfour seemed to have towards
Mr. Dillon an unusual amount of personal animosity.
Speaking with want of grace and personal courtesy, which
are things, I am bound to say, uncommon with him, he
accused Mr. Dillon of deliberate and conscious hypocrisy.
This also was a tactical blunder, and will largely account
for the transformation following, to which I am going to
refer.</p>

<div class="sn">The transformation.</div>

<p>The House on the following day, July 4th, was very still
when Mr. Dillon rose&mdash;evidently to refer to the
incident of the previous night. His address was
quiet, brief, and graceful. With charming
modesty, he acknowledged the mistake he had made, and
explained how, in running over in memory the hundreds of
speeches he had delivered, he had confounded one speech
with another. He was unable to understand how his
memory, which never before had played him false, had done
him this ill turn, and he appealed to the House generally,
and declared that there was not even amongst his bitter
political foes one who would think him capable of trying to
palm off on the House a speech which could be so palpably
and so readily exposed. In these few sentences, Mr. Dillon
brought before the House his strange, picturesque, and
chequered career. His oratory was such that the explanation
was considered the best ever given in the House of
Commons.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe is
absent.</div>

<p>This was a recovery of some ground lost on the previous
night. But there was even better to come. Mr.
Harrington's accuracy and veracity as to Mr.
Chamberlain's dealings with the Irish members
had been challenged, as I have said, by Mr. Chamberlain,
and he now rose to read the historic letter of Mr. Duignan,
which, he claimed, justified his account. Several attempts
were made to stop Mr. Harrington, and the Tories during
this were decidedly annoyed and embarrassed because Mr.
Chamberlain happened not to be in his place. But doggedly
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226" class="pagenum" title="Page 226"></a>
and persistently Mr. Harrington held to his ground, and at
last the Speaker allowed him to read the letter. The reading
of the letter led to various scenes, because it was one of
those balanced utterances in which Mr. Chamberlain used
to try to hold one foot in the Unionist and to place the other
in the Home Rule camp. There were speeches about the
County Councils, and there had been Unionist and Tory
cheers in relief; but when immediately afterwards there were
allusions to Home Rule, very little different in scope or
character from that proposed by Mr. Gladstone, there was
a triumphant rejoinder from the Liberal and Home Rule
Benches. Austen Chamberlain, excited, nervous, angered,
flitted to and fro in the attempt to gather forces to defend his
absent parent. At last Mr. Courtney took up his case. There
was not very much in what he said, and while he was
speaking Mr. Chamberlain entered the House. He was pale,
excited, and unnerved. He endeavoured to carry the whole
thing by a jauntiness which was too easy to see through.
Mr. Courtney had been waving furiously a telegram towards
the Speaker, and asked that he might have the privilege of
reading it. Austen Chamberlain snatched the telegram from
Mr. Courtney, and gave it to his father just as he had taken
his seat. Mr. Chamberlain had not a moment to spare; he
had just time to glance at the contents of the telegram when
he rose to speak, and all he did was to read the telegram,
which was a confirmation by Mr. Duignan of the general
accuracy of the previous evening. This was a score for Joe,
and his friends were delighted to recover something of their
lost spirit.</p>

<p>[Mr. Conybeare
and
the Speaker.]</p>

<p>Mr. Conybeare had written a letter to the <i>Chronicle</i>
denouncing the Speaker. Mr. Tritton, a Tory
member, insisted the letter should be read, and
this gave the Speaker one of those few opportunities
which his position allows him. In disclaiming this
charge he showed his great powers of oratory and the
splendid and thrilling notes of his fine voice. He defended
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227" class="pagenum" title="Page 227"></a>
himself at once from the charge of undue partiality with
strong passion and deep emotion, which lie hidden beneath
his deep reserve. With a face ghastly almost in its greyness,
in its deepening glows and manifest passion, he repudiated
the charge of unfairness; he vehemently struck his hand
on the order paper which he held, and as he neared to the
end of his little speech there was a ring in his voice dangerously
near a sob or a tear. It is on such occasions that
Mr. Gladstone's sonorous and splendid diction and delivery
come most to the front; beginning a little awkwardly,
hesitatingly, he warmed as he went along, and there came
to him the strange power of collecting his thoughts and
measuring his language which long years of Parliamentary
training has made a second nature. The House listened&mdash;rapt,
hushed,
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;spell-bound.&quot; in the original text">spellbound.</ins>
And then there was no more to
be said beyond a few perfunctory observations from Mr.
Balfour and the dismissal of the whole subject.</p>

<div class="sn">Another
scene.</div>

<p>And now we were once more in the thick of a fierce and
passionate encounter. Mr. Arnold Forster had
an amendment, the effect of which was to remove
the exercise of the prerogative of mercy
from the hands of the Irish members to those of the English
Secretary of State. Into this innocent amendment he sought
to drag discussion of the doings of the Land League twelve
years ago, and concentrated on Mr. Sexton a violent attack.
He was not allowed to proceed to the end of his chapter.
The charge was heinous, vile, and such as has rarely been
introduced in the House in such a fashion, and soon the
temper rose to a fever heat. Mr. Sexton is a dangerous man
to tackle in this guise.</p>

<p>In justifiable rage, quivering with wrath, he yet managed
to preserve that cold and even tenour of language so perfect
to his heart and his words. Again and again the Tory and
Unionist party cheer for Mr. Balfour, Mr. Courtney, and Mr.
Chamberlain, but Mr. Sexton is not a man to suffer such a
statement to go unchallenged, and he succeeded in grasping
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228" class="pagenum" title="Page 228"></a>
the whole thing and stamped the charge with the terms, base
and infamous. This led to other scenes, men rising and
talking together.</p>

<p>Mr. Chamberlain turned fierce in fore front. Again and
again Mr. Gladstone arose to try and end the scene, and
again and again he was prevented by Mr. T.W. Russell at
one point, Mr. Chamberlain at another, and Mr. Balfour at
a third, to seek to bring the struggle back to the fierce temper
it was about to leave. But the Old Man at last got up,
and in measured language and tones which betrayed profound
emotion, he scathingly denounced the attack of Mr. Forster
as wanton and mischievous. Here again there was another
uproar. The Old Man pursued his way, but Mr. Chamberlain
again tried to get Mr. Sexton called to order, but the charge
had been too coarse, and Mr. Mellor declined to interfere.</p>

<h3>REDUCED MAJORITIES.</h3>


<div class="sn">The week
before.</div>

<p>On Friday, July 7th, we just entered on the fringe of the
ninth clause. The ninth clause had all along
been held to be, perhaps, the very gravest
rock ahead of the Government. This is the
clause which regulates the position of the Irish members
at Westminster after Home Rule has been passed. There
were as many plans for settling this question as there
were members of the House of Commons, and all plans
were alike in being illogical, unsymmetrical, and, therefore,
liable to attack from a dozen different quarters. Already
within a few days of each other, there had been two
divisions, on which everybody felt it to be quite possible that
the Government would go down, and that we should once
more go back face to face with the country and probably with
a new and a stronger Tory Government than ever. The
first occasion was the clause dealing with a Second Chamber.
Then a certain number of irreconcilable Radicals, in their
hatred of all Second Chambers, voted against the Government
and reduced their majority to 15. This was a very
tight squeeze; but, after all, everybody had been prepared
for it, and when the hour came, we all knew pretty well
where we should be. There might be one or two men more
or less in the Tory lobby, but we had sized them up carefully.
When, however, July 19th, and the ninth clause came we
<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230" class="pagenum" title="Page 230"></a>
were face to face with a very different state of affairs. Then
we had to face absolute uncertainty&mdash;and uncertainty not
in one, but almost every part of the House. And the curious
thing about it all was, that this uncertainty was aggravated
by a little fact which had entered into nobody's calculations,
and this was the highly technical rule with regard to the
manner in which questions are put when the House is in
committee.</p>

<div class="sn">Technicalities.</div>

<p>I despair of ever being able to make this matter clear to
an outsider; and, indeed, to be quite honest, I am
not always sure that I understand the affair myself.
It will probably be sufficient for my
purpose if I say that the chairman has to put an amendment
in such a way that sometimes you find you are really precluded
from voting on the direct question which you wish
to challenge. You are within the ring-fence of a technical
rule, which compels you to fight your issue there and not
one inch outside of it. This often means that questions are
raised in the most indirect way&mdash;that you seem to be
voting for one thing while you really mean another, and that
if you do not vote that way, you cannot vote any other. So
it happened on this occasion. And we drifted about for the
best way of raising the question of the presence of the Irish
members, and the Government were for a while in a state
of absolute and painful uncertainty. Then came one of
those desultory conversations on points of order, in which
so large a body as the House of Commons cannot shine&mdash;one
man suggesting one method, one man another; half-a-dozen
different methods proposed in as many minutes by
half-a-dozen different members.</p>

<div class="sn">103 v. 80.</div>

<p>At last Mr. Redmond seemed to hit off the situation by a
proposal to omit a couple of sub-sections in the
ninth clause. But Mr. Redmond had scarcely
spoken when the House found itself in an extraordinary and
most embarrassing dilemma. The object of Mr. Redmond
was plain enough; what he desired to do was to retain the
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231" class="pagenum" title="Page 231"></a>
Irish members in the Imperial Parliament in their present,
that is to say, in their full, strength&mdash;103 they are now,
103 he wanted them to remain. The position of the
Government was equally clear. With emphatic language&mdash;with
a superabundance of argument&mdash;Mr. Gladstone stated
his conviction that the Irish members should not remain
in such large numbers and that the number
should be 80. This was all clear enough; but what
about the position of all the other parties in the
House?</p>

<div class="sn">Tot homines,
tot sententi&aelig;.</div>

<p>At first sight, it would appear that this ought to be very
clear. The Tories and the Unionists had several
amendments on the paper. One wanted the Irish
members reduced to 48, one wanted to have them
reduced to 40, and several of them desired that they should
be reduced still further&mdash;in fact, should reach the irreducible
minimum of none at all. It was assumed, of course, that
gentlemen who had thus indicated their desire for the
reduction of the Irish members, or for their disappearance
altogether, would vote against a proposition which asked that
they should remain in full force. If this course were
adopted, Mr. Redmond would be crushed under a combination
of the Liberals, who wanted the numbers to be 80, and
the Tories who wanted the Irish members to disappear
altogether; but in these days, and with such an Opposition
as we have now in the House of Commons, it is not possible
to make any calculations on what course we would adopt.
To the amazement of the House&mdash;above all things to the
amazement of Mr. Gladstone&mdash;who has not yet entirely got
over the traditions of the past, and, therefore, over-sanguine
expectations as to the scruples of his opponents&mdash;Mr.
Chamberlain and Mr. Balfour both announced that they
were ready to go into the same lobby as Mr. Redmond.
And so those who wanted all the Irish members, and those
who wanted none, were both going to vote exactly the
same way.</p>

<div><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232" class="pagenum" title="Page 232"></a></div>
<div class="sn">A bolt from
the blue.</div>

<p>For a moment everybody was staggered by this declaration;
and it produced a combination which
anybody could forecast, and for which nobody
was prepared. There came accordingly something
like a panic over the House. Here we were face to face
with a Ministerial crisis, with doom and the abyss and the
end of all things. Unexpectedly, in a moment, without a
second's warning, this state of things led to a phenomenon
which belongs to the House of Commons alone. Councils of
war are usually held in the silence and secrecy and beneath
the impenetrable walls of the council chamber. But sudden
councils of war, called for by unexpected events, have to be
held in the open in the House of Commons. The world&mdash;the
world of strangers, of ambassadors, of peers, of ladies,
of the constituents, and, above all, the world of watchful,
scornful, vindictive enemies&mdash;can look on as though the
leaders of the parties were bees working in a glass hive.
And it is impossible for even the best trained men
to keep their air and manners in such dread circumstances
from betraying the seriousness and excitement
and awe which the gravity of the events are exciting in
them.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Gladstone's
attitude.</div>

<p>On the Treasury Bench there was a good deal of excitement,
but it was pretty well repressed: and in
the midst of it all is the face of Mr. Gladstone,
over-pale, with a strange glitter in the eyes that
made them look unnaturally large, two jets of lambent and
almost dazzling flame, but otherwise very composed, deadly
calm. On the Irish Benches the excitement was more tense,
for their course was even more difficult than that of the
Government. The Government had stated their decision that
they wanted only eighty members. But there was an Irish
member, a leader of a party which seeks to claim Irish support
as a better Irish party than the other, proposing that
Ireland should have her full total of members. The Irish
members naturally would be inclined to support their
coun<a name="Page_233" id="Page_233" class="pagenum" title="Page 233"></a>trymen,
if not to seek to keep the Irish representation as high
as it could possibly be.</p>

<div class="sn">A splendid
gambler.</div>

<p>On the other hand, if all the Irish members went the same
way it was all up with the Government. Some
fifty to seventy British Liberals adopt the same
policy as the Irish members with regard to the
Irish question and the Home Rule Bill, and if the Irish members
only give the word, they also would vote with Mr. Redmond,
and the Government would be &quot;snowed under,&quot; to
use an expressive Americanism, a majority of upwards of two
hundred against them. Mr. Gladstone had evidently made
up his mind that this was the situation he would have to face,
and played his last, his supreme, his desperate card. You
could see that he himself felt that this was the kind of card
he was playing from his look as he played it. There was outward
calmness in the face, there was the same evenness of
tone in the voice; he built up his case with the same unbroken
command of his language and ideas as is his usual characteristic.
His statement of his position was admirable in its
lucidity, its temper, and its courage. But he was excited.
Just as he rose up, Sir William Harcourt jumped up, and
in a state of impatience and excitement that was palpable,
asked for something. It was a glass of water for Mr. Gladstone.
The glass of water was brought in; it was put in
front of Mr. Gladstone; he sipped it just as he was about to
start on his perilous oratorical voyage, and then, clearing his
throat, he made the fateful announcement which possibly was
to wreck his measure and himself. And the statement came
to this: If the Government were defeated, it would be by a
combination of different parties, but they would all agree in
supporting 103 as against 80 Irish members; and if they did
that, why the House was master. This was ambiguous, and
yet it was pretty plain. The Government declined to accept
as a vote of want of confidence in them a majority which was
obtained by so dishonest and treacherous a combination as
men voting together who were at such opposite poles of
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234" class="pagenum" title="Page 234"></a>
thought; and the Government would just checkmate the little
game by accepting the 103 members as what the House preferred
to the Government plan of 80.</p>

<div class="sn">The fall of
the flag.</div>

<p>There was a gleam of almost sardonic triumph in the Old
Man's eye as he sat down, having shot this bolt;
and he looked as if he had thoroughly discomfited
his enemies. But his enemies were not so easily
discomfited. Treacherous, base, unscrupulous, call it what he
liked, they were not going to miss the opportunity of baiting
him: and Mr. Chamberlain's pale face wore a deadlier pallor.
There was even a colder and fiercer ring than usual in his
clear, cruel voice; his always saturnine look deepened as he
seemed to grasp beforehand his great and long delayed hour
of vengeance. Mr. Balfour adopted the same tactics. In
favour of 103 members? Not at all&mdash;the vote would mean
nothing of that kind&mdash;it would simply mean that they were
opposed to the plan of the Government; in short, there was
the issue quite plain. The Tories and the Unionists would
vote black was white, wrong was right. This way one
moment, the other way the next&mdash;they would do anything,
provided only they could turn the Government out, defeat the
Bill, and humiliate the Old Man. And so the situation grew
more difficult every moment.</p>

<p>For it was now plain that the Government were most
certain to be beaten, and that if they were beaten, there must
be an end of Home Rule. It might be good Parliamentary
tactics to say that the Government would accept the decision
of the House, but everybody knows what moral authority,
what reality of strength, there is in a Government which has
been &quot;snowed under&quot; by a majority of 200.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Sexton
makes the
running.</div>

<p>It will now be understood what tremendous issues rested
on the speech which Mr. Sexton rose to deliver.
In moments of stress and difficulty he is the man
always selected by his colleagues to state the Irish
case. Never in his chequered and stormy early career did that
wonderful Parliamentarian have a task more difficult than
<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235" class="pagenum" title="Page 235"></a>
that by which he was now confronted. In front of him was
the Government in the very panic of impending ruin. He
had only to look across the floor of the House, and he could
see the pallid face of that mighty statesman who lives so high
in the hearts and affections of the people whom Mr. Sexton
represents, and who at that moment was in his hour of agony,
if not of final and irretrievable ruin. Behind the Prime
Minister were other men&mdash;equally eager to hear what he had
to say&mdash;that sturdy band of Radicals, mostly from Scotland,
who only wanted the word to desert their own leader and
follow the guidance of the Irish members. And behind Mr.
Sexton was the grimmest enemy of all&mdash;the men from his own
country, who were resolved, on this occasion, to push the
demand of Ireland to the extreme point, and who held that he
would betray the Irish cause if he backed, not them, but Mr.
Gladstone and the British Government.</p>

<div class="sn">And takes
the lead.</div>

<p>It required all the dexterity, all the coolness, all the
splendid equanimity and courage of the man of
genius at such a fateful hour to keep his head.
Mr. Sexton was equal to the occasion. He spoke
slowly, and there was a hush in the House to catch his
every syllable, for his words were the harbingers of fate. As
he spoke so would be decided one of the most momentous and
indeed tragical of human issues. He spoke, I say, slowly&mdash;but
at the same time it was evident that he had his mind well fixed
on the end which he wished to reach. Nothing adds so much
to the effectiveness of oratory as the sense that the man who
is addressing you, is thinking at the very moment he is speaking.
You have the sense of watching the visible working of
his inner mind; and you are far more deeply impressed than
by the glib facility which does not pause, does not stumble,
does not hesitate, because he does not stop to think. Many
people, reading so much about Mr. Sexton's oratory, will be
under the impression that he is a very rapid and fluent
speaker. He is nothing of the kind. He speaks with a great
slowness, grave deliberation, and there are often long and
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236" class="pagenum" title="Page 236"></a>
sometimes even trying pauses between his sentences. He
could not conceal on this great occasion the anxiety and
the seriousness of the situation; but the mind was splendidly
clear, the language as well chosen as though he were sitting
in a room and holding discourse to a few admiring friends;
and what Mr. Sexton had to say was, that he would not go
into the same lobby with Chamberlain and Balfour in order
to defeat the Government; in short, that he was going to
vote with Mr. Gladstone. A long-drawn sigh of relief. The
Government is saved.</p>

<div class="sn">The field
unsteady.</div>

<p>But hush&mdash;not yet. There are still some of the hard
Radicals from Scotland who have never wavered
in the idea that the Irish members ought to
remain at their full total. They have been partially
relieved by what Mr. Sexton had said. But then
Scotchmen are proverbially tenacious of opinion; and not
even his appeal&mdash;joined to the appeal of their leader&mdash;will
altogether change the purpose of those rugged sons of bonnie
Scotland. And so, Mr. Shaw, the member for Galashiels,
gets up to ask a question. He plainly declares that according
to the answer given to this question, his vote would be given
for or against the Government. So we are still in all the
agonies of possible delay, for we know that seven Parnellites
will go against the Government&mdash;that counts fourteen on a
division; and if only seven or ten more go the same way,
there is a majority against Mr. Gladstone, and we are lost.
Mr. Mellor has to answer this fateful question, and everybody
cries &quot;Order, order,&quot; which is the House of Commons way of
saying that people are very anxious to hear what is about to
be said. Mr. Mellor gives an answer that satisfies Mr. Shaw.
Mr. Dalziel&mdash;another sturdy Scotch Radical&mdash;is also satisfied;
and so we have all the Liberal vote, with the single
exception of Labby&mdash;who quickly&mdash;furtively&mdash;almost shamefacedly&mdash;rushes
off into the Tory lobby.</p>

<div class="sn">Hoisting the
numbers.</div>

<p>And now the division takes place. There have been
several speeches&mdash;usually of a minute each&mdash;before the
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237" class="pagenum" title="Page 237"></a>
final hour comes; but we are all so anxious to know what
fate is in store for us, that we cannot stand
the strain any longer. The division&mdash;the division&mdash;let
us know the worst. Be it good, or be it ill&mdash;let
it come at once. The Whips from the two lobbies enter
almost simultaneously&mdash;this shows plainly enough that it has
been a very near thing; then a dreadful hush as the numbers
are announced; we have won&mdash;aye, but we have by only
fourteen! There is a burst of cheers from the Irish Benches;
Sir William Harcourt laughs aloud in his triumph; the composure
of the Old Man's face remains unchanged; you see he
has gone through a great many things like this; and that
great heart and sane mind are prepared for any fate. Mr.
Chamberlain says nothing; but looking into the recesses of
his amendment paper, attempts to hide the choking rage of
disappointment that has come over him at this final defeat
of his brightest hopes of trampling his former friend and his
former chief in the dust.</p>

<div class="sn">A squabble.</div>

<p>And now comes the squalid sequel to all this glorious and
splendid fight&mdash;the disorderly&mdash;the chaotic&mdash;the
anarchic scene of the 11th of July. The whole
thing began simply enough. Mr. Brodrick, the son of an
Irish landlord&mdash;a very light, though very serious young man&mdash;managed
in the course of his speech to speak of the people
from whom he springs as &quot;impecunious and garrulous.&quot; At
first nobody took any notice of what was probably a mere
mauvaise plaisanterie; and the incident would have passed
altogether had not Mr. Brodrick immediately afterwards made
a more direct appeal to the Irish Members. This elicited
from Mr. Sexton the retort that he need not make any appeal
to the Irish Benches after the &quot;grossly rude&quot; allusion he
had made to the Irish people. On this there was a mild hubbub
on the Tory Benches. The House was very thin and
very listless, and really not in the mood to take anything
very tragically. But Mr. Sexton resolutely refused to withdraw
unless Mr. Brodrick gave the example. Mr. Mellor
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238" class="pagenum" title="Page 238"></a>
then&mdash;acting somewhat precipitately&mdash;ruled that Mr.
Sexton was out of order, and should withdraw his
words.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Sexton
defies the
chair.</div>

<p>This created a new situation. Mr. Sexton had now to
fight, not Mr. Brodrick, not even Mr. Balfour&mdash;but
the chair; and to fight the chair is to enter
into a contest with the Grand Llama of the
House of Commons. Meantime the House had filled; and
every nook and cranny was occupied; a large number of
members were standing up; and there was that intense thrill
of excitement which always forecasts a great outburst, and
the outburst came when Mr. Sexton&mdash;resolute and composed&mdash;gave
it plainly to be understood that he would not obey
the ruling of the chair; and that he must first get an apology
from Mr. Brodrick, as the original offender, before Mr. Brodrick
got any apology from him. Then was the cyclone let
loose; and there began a series of the wildest, most violent,
most angry, and disorderly scenes I have ever witnessed.
Scores of members were on their legs at the same time; men
hitherto quiet, composed, and good-natured, began to raise
cries hoarse with rage, and finally four or five hundred
voices were united in producing the deafening and discordant
din of angry and contradictory voices. Nor was this all. In
some parts of the House men began directly to assail each
other&mdash;to exchange language of taunt, and insult, and defiance;
and, in more than one corner, there were the signs of
impending physical conflict. The one relief of the situation
was that some men kept their heads and looked on in sadness,
while others, seeing only the comic side of the situation,
smiled upon it all.</p>

<div class="sn">Gladstone to
the rescue.</div>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, who had been away to dinner, had
meantime entered, and a look of pain and solicitude
crossed his white face. There is so much of
innate gentleness&mdash;of inexhaustible kindliness,
and of high-bred and scholastic spirit beneath all the vehemence
of his political temper and the frenzied energy of his
<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239" class="pagenum" title="Page 239"></a>
political life&mdash;that for such scenes he has never any stomach;
and they always bring to his face that same look of shock
and pain and humiliation. And he it was who finally saved
the situation. Several times Mr. Brodrick would have been
willing to withdraw, but Mr. Balfour was resolved to get Mr.
Gladstone and Mr. Sexton into a difficulty, to convict Mr.
Sexton of disobeying the chair, to compel Mr. Gladstone to
take action against his most useful friend and most powerful
ally. Over and over again, then, he refused to allow Mr.
Brodrick to get rid of the whole situation by withdrawing his
language, and so enabling Mr. Sexton to follow the example.
Meantime, Mr. Mellor had ruled that Mr. Sexton had been
guilty of gross disorder, and had called upon him to leave the
House. Mr. Sexton had steadily refused, basing his refusal
on the demand that there had been no vote of the House.
The point was this: There are two rules for dealing with
disorder. Under the one a member is named, and then a
division takes place, in which the House may refuse or consent
to the suspension of a member. Under the other rule,
the presiding officer has the right to suspend on his own
motion, and without any appeal to the House. The latter
rule was that under which Mr. Mellor acted. Mr. Sexton
demanded that he should be treated under the other rule,
believing that if a division had taken place the majority of
the House, or at least a very big minority, would have refused
to sanction the action of the Chairman. This would have
meant that Mr. Mellor would have been censured, and thereby
compelled to resign the Chairmanship.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, I say, saved the situation. In language
of touching delicacy and grace, he appealed to Mr. Sexton to
obey the chair. Mr. Sexton at first would not yield; but
when the appeal was renewed&mdash;when it was backed by all the
resources of that thrilling and vibratory voice of Mr. Gladstone,
his stubborn resolve gave way. He rose from his
seat&mdash;several Liberal members got up and waved their hats;
the Irishmen followed their example. And then Mr.
Brod<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240" class="pagenum" title="Page 240"></a>rick
was able to make his tardy apology, and the matter for
the moment was ended.</p>

<div class="sn">The interfering
Milman.</div>

<p>There had been one little scene fiercer almost than any
of the others. When Mr. Mellor proceeded to
call Mr. Sexton to order, Mr. Milman, the clerk
at the table, handed to him, with some appearance
of ostentation and of eagerness, the rule which allowed
him to compel Mr. Sexton's withdrawal without an appeal
to the House. This provoked some now fiercely excited
Irishmen to an outburst of blind rage. They shouted at Mr.
Milman fiercely, desperately&mdash;called upon him to leave the
Chairman alone, to take the chair himself; and Mr. Sexton
made a bitter little speech to the effect that it was Mr. Milman's
malignant interference which had produced his suspension.
It was thought that on Wednesday this matter
would be again raised; and even as early as noon there was
a big array of members, expecting another outburst. But
Mr. Balfour held his peace. Mr. Sexton asked a formal
question, and gave notice of a motion of censure on the
Chairman. Mr. Mellor took the chair amid a wild outburst
of Tory cheers; and we got back to the tranquil consideration
of clause nine, and to a delightful, good-humoured historical
speech by Mr. Swift McNeill on the representation of Trinity
College, Dublin.</p>

<div class="sn">Divisions.</div>

<p>The old story came back to our minds on July 13th of the
historic scene at Tyburn when all the traitors were
hanged in succession. When the first head was
held up there was an awful shudder; the shudder was less
vivid when the second head was held up; and when the
executioner accidentally dropped the third there was a loud
and mocking shout of &quot;Butter-fingers.&quot; So it was in the
House that night until the dinner hour came; but as ten
o'clock approached, the House filled and there was a rise in the
excitement. The scene, however, bore no comparison to the
frenzied excitement of the preceding Thursday&mdash;it was evident
we were going to have an anti-climax, and the whole
arrange<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241" class="pagenum" title="Page 241"></a>ment
of the Opposition broke down in an important and
essential point. On the previous occasion Mr. Balfour, by
preconcerted plan, was speaking at the moment when the
guillotine fell&mdash;with the idea, of course, of bringing into
greater relief the wickedness of the Government. Mr. Goschen
was marked out to perform the same task this Thursday, but
who should get up but Atherley Jones. The delighted Liberals
cheered him to the echo. Mr. Goschen had to sit down, and
so the whole d&eacute;nouement collapsed, and the curtain fell not
on the lofty and eminent form of a former Chancellor of the
Exchequer, but on the less imposing figure of the disgruntled
Liberal, who is always anxious to strike his party a blow.</p>

<p>Then comes the division. There is some excitement,
though we know we have won. And then we cheer, as we
hear that we have won by 27! Clause 9 is now put as a
whole. Our majority rises to 29&mdash;we cheer even more
loudly.</p>

<div class="sn">Tramp,
Tramp,
Tramp.</div>

<p>We go through the lobbies in eight more successive divisions.
It is the dreariest performance. &quot;That
Clause so-and-so stand part of the Bill,&quot; says the
Chairman. A shout of &quot;Ayes!&quot; followed by a
shout of &quot;Noes!&quot;&mdash;then a cry of &quot;Division!&quot;&mdash;then the
same thing over again&mdash;and again&mdash;and again. We stand at
85 majority in nearly every division. But we don't cheer,
for it is too monotonous; and as for the poor Tories&mdash;where
be the wild shouts of &quot;Gag, gag!&quot; with which they rent the
general air&mdash;their hoarse cries of &quot;Shame, shame&quot;&mdash;their
open and foul taunts in the face of the G.O.M.? Silent&mdash;sombre&mdash;dogged&mdash;we
go through the dreary round. Tout
casse&mdash;tout passe&mdash;tout lasse.</p>

<h3>THE FIGHT IN THE HOUSE.</h3>


<div class="sn">The fatal
Thursday.</div>

<p>By this time everybody has read to his heart's content all
the proceedings of that historic and dreadful
Thursday night. I have already published elsewhere
an account of my experiences; and within
my limits here I must somewhat curtail the story. But it is
well to correct some of the many errors which have found
their way into the press. In the slight reaction which has
followed the first wild outburst, it is now seen that there were
certain exaggerations in the accounts. For instance, though
there was an exchange of blows, altogether not more than five
people were concerned in this most odious part of the whole
transaction.</p>

<div class="sn">Herod&mdash;Judas.</div>

<p>The row began in a curious kind of way; and, indeed, to
properly understand the events of the night, it is
necessary to make a perfectly complete separation
between two distinct periods. The fall of the
guillotine is always certain to be accompanied by a scene of
some excitement and violence. The violence has been
diminishing steadily, as the different compartments have
succeeded each other; and though there were some ugly
rumours, the general expectation was that things would not
be so very bad. And, indeed, without any desire to make
party or personal capital, I may state that undoubtedly they
would not have been so bad if Mr. Chamberlain had not
intervened at the last moment. Opinion is unanimous that up
<a name="Page_243" id="Page_243" class="pagenum" title="Page 243"></a>
to the time he spoke the feeling in the House was, though
boisterous, rather good humoured. There was a conflict of
opinion, there were some shouts, there was that general din
in the air which always marks the inspiration of a momentous
event, but there was no ill-temper. In a few moments Mr.
Chamberlain had, to a certain extent, changed this; but even
as to the period when he was speaking, I feel bound to correct
the general impression and to say that my own opinion
was that the general spirit was one of frolicksome enjoyment
rather than of the seriousness of real passion. Mr. Chamberlain
himself, to do him justice&mdash;though he had elaborated a
series of the most taunting observations, though sentence
after sentence was intended to be an assault and a barbed
taunt&mdash;Mr. Chamberlain, I say, seemed himself to regard the
whole affair rather from a comic than a tragic point of view.
Under the bitterness of his language, the tone was not that of
seriousness&mdash;and, indeed, it is very hard for any man to be
perfectly serious when he knows that he is speaking for a
certain number of allotted minutes, and instead of addressing
himself to the particular question before the House, he has to
make something in the shape of a last dying speech and
declaration. The speech, however, was admirable in form,
and still more admirable in delivery; the cold, clear voice
penetrated to every ear, and some of the sentences were
uttered with that deep, though carefully subdued swell which
adds intense force by its very reserve, to the rhetoric of
passion.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe's beautiful
elocution.</div>

<p>Indeed, if I were a professor of elocution, I should feel
bound to say that if a pupil required a lesson in
the highest art of delivery, he could do nothing
better than listen to Mr. Chamberlain's delivery
of this bitter little speech of his; and, above all, that he could
nowhere and in nowise better learn the lesson of the extraordinary
increase there is in the force of a speech by careful
self-suppression on the part of the speaker. There were one
or two marvellous examples of Mr. Chamberlain's
extra<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244" class="pagenum" title="Page 244"></a>ordinary
readiness in taking a point. I think Mr. Chamberlain
an extremely shallow man. I believe his knowledge to
be slatternly, his judgment to be rash, his temper to be
dictatorial and uncertain, but as a debater he stands, in readiness,
alertness, and quickness in taking and utilising a point,
supreme over anybody in the House of Commons, with the
one exception of Mr. Gladstone. Thus when one or two
Liberals made somewhat foolish interruptions on July 27th
he turned upon them and exploited their interruption with an
art that was almost dazzling in its perfection. For instance,
when he denounced the Liberals for accepting some clause as
the best that could be proposed by man, some Liberals cried
out, &quot;Under the circumstances.&quot; &quot;Under the circumstances,&quot;
said Mr. Chamberlain, with that strange, eloquent,
deep swell in his voice, which adds so much to its effectiveness,
and then he took the phrase, repeated it, and reiterated
it, and turned it upside down, until even his bitterest enemy
could not help enjoying the perfection of the skill with which
he played upon it.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe smiles.</div>

<p>Finally he came to the passage in which he drew an
elaborate comparison between Mr. Gladstone and
Herod. I had no doubt at the time, and my
impression has since been corroborated by words reported to
have been used by Mr. Chamberlain himself&mdash;that he used
the word &quot;Herod&quot; in a moment of happy and almost
impish inspiration with a view to provoking the retort which
was so obvious. There was a self-conscious smile on his
face when he uttered the words, and he seemed to be quite
prepared, and almost delighted by the retort which followed
so promptly. Furthermore, when several Tories rose to denounce
the interruption he beckoned to them with his hand;
there was a gratified smile on his face; and his whole air
suggested that he was so delighted with the success of his
little manoeuvre that he thought it a pity anybody should
spoil it; and especially as the result was to create such a
din as to prevent him from finishing his final sentence.
<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245" class="pagenum" title="Page 245"></a>
And he wanted very badly to finish that sentence; for over
and over again, with an obstinacy that suggested the delighted
author, he sought to get the sentence out; and no
doubt he was very disappointed that the guillotine finally fell
upon him with that sentence still unuttered. And there is
one other point about this moment which I see has been
completely lost. It is supposed that I and the others who
shouted &quot;Judas, Judas,&quot; did so in pure provocation&mdash;with
deliberate intent to apply the word to Mr. Chamberlain
personally and with fierce political and personal passion.
That was not my impression of what was meant; and that
certainly was not what I meant. I took Mr. Chamberlain's
mood as I think anybody looking at him could see that he
meant it to be taken; that is to say, I did not regard his
speech as in the least serious; and his allusion to Mr. Gladstone
as &quot;Herod&quot; appeared to me a self-conscious joke, and
not, as some earnest Liberals seemed to think, a gross, foul,
and deliberate insult. Indeed, I believed&mdash;and subsequent
events have confirmed that view&mdash;that Joe was thinking a
good deal more of himself as the centre of a dramatic and
historic scene than of wounding Mr. Gladstone. And, then,
the use of the word &quot;Judas&quot; must be taken with the context.
Mr. Chamberlain was talking of the &quot;days of Herod,&quot;
and when I called out &quot;Judas,&quot; what I really meant was
why not select Judas, and not Herod, who was his contemporary,
if you will refer to this particular epoch of human
history. I say all these things, not by way of extenuation;
for really I regard the incident as closed; not by way of
defending myself from rancour, for I felt none; but with a
view to preventing an entirely incorrect view and impression
of an historical evening from being stereotyped.</p>

<div class="sn">&quot;I used it on
purpose.&quot;</div>

<p>And I can call a very potent and trustworthy witness as
to this being the proper view of the incident;
for I understand that, almost immediately after
the scene, a good-natured Liberal said to Mr.
Chamberlain that he must confess that the use of the word
&quot;<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246" class="pagenum" title="Page 246"></a>Herod&quot;
was calculated to produce the retort of &quot;Judas&quot;;
and the report is that Mr. Chamberlain replied, &quot;I used it
on purpose,&quot; or &quot;That was my intention,&quot; or some such
phrase as that, which implied that he was neither surprised
nor annoyed by the retort, but had rather invited it. I lost
sight of Joe for a good time after this&mdash;there were other
things which had to be looked after; but I am told by those
who were able to watch him closely, that his face wore all
through the scene which followed a look of almost beatific
happiness&mdash;the happiness of an artist who saw slowly
unfolding the drama to which he had given the impetus,
and which he had fashioned out in his own reveries.</p>

<div class="sn">Opening of
the row.</div>

<p>At all events, it was not either Mr. Chamberlain's use
of the word &quot;Herod,&quot; nor my use of the word
&quot;Judas,&quot; which really brought about the subsequent
row&mdash;except in the most indirect and
remote way. Mr. Vicary Gibbs seemed possessed by the
idea that he should call the attention of the Chairman to
the use of the word &quot;Judas&quot;; and he singled me out&mdash;although,
of course, he knew that I was only one of many
who had used the word. I don't complain of this&mdash;I merely
state a fact&mdash;a fact which, laughingly, was admitted later in
the evening; for here I may say in passing that such is the
extraordinary volatility and such the real good-nature of the
House of Commons, this terrible evening ended up in the
exchange of hearty and friendly jokes between some of the
fiercest combatants in the whole business. I had not the
least idea of what Mr. Gibbs was saying&mdash;what his complaint
really was I knew for the first time after the whole
row was over; indeed, nobody could hear anything in the
din that was almost deafening. Mr. Mellor made several
attempts to catch Mr. Gibbs's statement; and only when,
after straining his ears to the utmost, he failed to catch one
single word, did Mr. Mellor resolve to take no notice of
what Mr. Gibbs was trying to say. This seemed to drive
Mr. Gibbs almost beside himself&mdash;he shouted angrily and
<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247" class="pagenum" title="Page 247"></a>
wildly, at the top of his voice, with fierce and almost
frenzied gesture; and, after a while, he rushed down with
every appearance of passion to the Front Opposition Bench
to renew his attempts to make his point of order. All this
time his passion had been rising higher and higher&mdash;until,
in the end, he was almost a painful sight to witness. His
own friends were foremost in trying to bring him back to
composure; and Lord Randolph Churchill expressed, with
the fine, full-flavoured plainness of ancient speech, his
opinion of the conduct of his friends.</p>

<div class="sn">Keeping the
seats.</div>

<p>This plain-spoken opinion of Lord Randolph Churchill
was induced by the fact that Mr. Gibbs and his
friends had now resolved on a desperate step to
secure attention to his complaint. This was no
other than refusing to leave the House, and take part in the
division. It is more than twelve years since this extreme,
violent, and almost revolutionary step was adopted before.
On the dreadful night&mdash;how well I remember it!&mdash;when the
news came that Michael Davitt had been sent back to penal
servitude, the information sent a thrill of such horror and
almost despair amongst the Irish Benches, that some
method of manifesting their feelings became inevitable. By
a series of circumstances, into which I need not now go,
the manifestation took the shape of refusing to go into the
division lobby, and retaining our seats. We were all suspended
in turn, and removed from the House by the
Serjeant-at-Arms.</p>

<div class="sn">Logan.</div>

<p>Meantime, the unexpected and extraordinary delay in
taking the division had brought back some
members from the division lobbies; and some
had actually recorded their votes, and were returning in
the ordinary course to their seats. Among these was Mr.
Logan. Mr. Logan peered somewhat curiously at the angry
faces and the shouting figures on the Tory Benches, and
approached them with the view of finding out what it was
all about. His air, somehow or other, suggested&mdash;quite
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248" class="pagenum" title="Page 248"></a>
wrongly, as it turned out&mdash;to the Tories that he was
meditating an assault upon some of them: and there rose
angry cries from them of &quot;Bar! Bar!&quot; This, in Parliamentary
language, means that the member is violating the
rule against any member standing on the floor of the House,
except in the narrow and short interspace which lies between
the entrance door and the bar&mdash;a very small bit of free
territory. Logan, in his turn, was exasperated by these
remarks, and used some retort. Then there were renewed
cries that he was not in order in standing up on the floor,
together with a multitude of expletives at the expense of
his party and himself. And Mr. Logan thereupon said he
would put himself in order, and sat down on the Front
Opposition Bench. In doing so, he certainly did put himself
in order, for a member can take his seat where he likes
during the progress of a division. But this step is what led
to the violent and unprecedented scene which followed. For
Mr. Hayes Fisher immediately caught hold of Mr. Logan by
the collar, Ashmead Bartlett, I understand, followed suit,
and thus the first blow was struck.</p>

<div class="sn">Colonel
Saunderson
hits out.</div>

<p>It was partly curiosity&mdash;it was partly, I have no doubt,
indignation&mdash;it was partly the determination to
rush to the assistance of a friend&mdash;that led to
the moving of the Irishmen from their own seats
to the benches above the gangway, which are occupied by
their political opponents. In making this move they had no
intention whatsoever, I believe, of striking or even hustling
anybody, but the result of it was that Colonel Saunderson
was violently pushed and his hat knocked off. I really
believe that the person next him, who gave him the final
push, must have been one of his own friends; but angry,
excited, and hot-tempered, he jumped to his feet. Mr.
Austin, an Irish member, was at that moment standing in
the gangway, as innocent of offence as anybody in the House,
and he it was who received the blow from Colonel Saunderson's
clenched fist. Mr. Austin fell, and immediately Mr.
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249" class="pagenum" title="Page 249"></a>
Crean rushed forward, and in quick succession gave Colonel
Saunderson two hard and resounding blows&mdash;one of which
drew blood.</p>

<div class="sn">The bursting
of the
cyclone.</div>

<p>Then the cyclone burst. When the sound of blows was
heard; when Colonel Saunderson was seen to be
in grips with another member, anger&mdash;shame&mdash;horror,
took possession of everybody; some men
lost their heads, determined to have their share in the fray,
and for a brief second or two a solid cohort on either side&mdash;the
Tories on one side, the Irish on the other&mdash;stared and
glared at each other, with pallid, passion-rent, and, at the
same time, horror-stricken faces&mdash;ready to descend into the
abyss, and yet standing in the full consciousness of horror
at its brink. William O'Brien, John Burns, Mr. Bowles, Mr.
Healy, Tom Condon, a stalwart and brave Tipperary man
ready for peace, ready for war, and several others&mdash;myself
included&mdash;rushed to separate and remonstrate, with the
result that the scene came to an end in a space which was
extraordinarily short, considering the circumstances, but
terribly long to those who lived through its horror. Really
only three people were in that scrimmage&mdash;Mr. Austin,
Colonel Saunderson and Mr. Crean. There was, I believe,
some hustling, but of even that I saw little. Whether it
was at this moment, or when Mr. Hayes Fisher laid hands
on Mr. Logan, the hissing came from the gallery, I do not
know; but it was at either of these two moments&mdash;a sound
hideous, unparalleled, sufficient to bring the maddest man
back to reason. And then, thinking once more that it was
all over, we went into the division lobbies again.</p>

<div class="sn">The Speaker
appears.</div>

<p>In common with most people, I had by this time forgotten
all about Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;all about Herod&mdash;all
about Judas; thinking the whole affair was over
and done with; that the incident had been submerged
under the row; and all I expected we had now to do
was to trudge drearily and wearily through the lobbies in the
long series of divisions which would precede the final passage
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250" class="pagenum" title="Page 250"></a>
of the Bill through Committee. It was only the wild
cheering which announced the advent of the Speaker that
brought me back to the House, and gave me some idea of
what had gone on. If you want to understand why France
welcomed Napoleon after the Terror, you had only to be in
the House at that moment, and understand the sense of
relief, joy, and confidence which came over it when the presence
of the Speaker brought it to the sense that at last
the reign of Anarchy was over, and order was in the hands
of one who could maintain it against all men, and against
the whole House if needs be. And then, to my astonishment,
Mr. Gibbs complained of my use of the term &quot;Judas&quot;
to Mr. Chamberlain. As I have said, all this had passed
from everybody's memory, it really had nothing to do with
the awful scene which had just been enacted, and, in fact,
it was like some sudden return to ancient and forgotten
history. Moreover, it had the disadvantage of conveying an
entirely wrong impression of what had really taken place;
it shifted back the attention to what was after all more or
less playfulness, or at the worst, mere verbal disorder, from
the odious, brutal resort to physical violence which had just
taken place. Moreover, it put a wrong complexion on even
the verbal disorder, for it put the initiative with me instead
of with Mr. Chamberlain, and, finally, it entirely removed
from view the gross and scandalous breach of order which
Mr. Gibbs and his friends had committed by retaining their
seats and refusing to leave the House.</p>

<div class="sn">My apology.</div>

<p>But the great consideration with the Speaker&mdash;and,
indeed, with everybody else who had the dignity
and honour of the House of Commons at heart&mdash;was
to shove underground as soon, as promptly, as roughly
as possible, the corpse of its dignity and reputation; and
without making any attempt to explain my conduct&mdash;to shift
on the responsibility to where it really lay&mdash;to draw attention,
except by a mere sentence, to that scene of physical violence&mdash;I
made my apology. I cannot claim that it was all that
<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251" class="pagenum" title="Page 251"></a>
I ought to have said; several people have blamed me for not
calling attention to the use of the word &quot;Herod&quot; by Mr.
Chamberlain. But really the Speaker was so generous; I
entered so fully into his idea that recrimination would only
prolong an odious, detestable, and degrading scene&mdash;that I
could not haggle about terms; and was determined to do my
part towards getting back the House to a sense of its honour,
dignity, and self-respect.</p>

<div class="sn">Mr. Hayes
Fisher.</div>

<p>There were some allusions to the deplorable business of
July 27, during the following week. But the allusions
were few&mdash;very brief, and very
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: &quot;shame-faced.&quot; in the original text">shamefaced.</ins>
Indeed, the House of Commons was so heartily
ashamed of itself that it had not the strength nor the courage
to face its own ill-doing, and wanted to get away from the
horrid thing as soon as it possibly could. Yet there was a strong
sense that an incident so unprecedented&mdash;so disgraceful, so
utterly lowering to the dignity of a great, august and historic
assembly&mdash;should not, and could not be allowed to pass as
though nothing had occurred. It was also pretty clear, amid
so many conflicting statements, that the responsibility for the
passing over the gulf between mere verbal encounter and
physical violence rested with Mr. Hayes Fisher, and that,
therefore, it was on him any punishment should be visited
which the House of Commons deemed necessary for the protection
of its outraged dignity. However, as I have said, the
House of Commons was so heartily ashamed of itself, and
desired to get its shame out of sight and out of memory as
soon as possible.</p>

<div class="sn">A lame
apology.</div>

<p>But Mr. Hayes Fisher did not act particularly well. It
was he who had taken Mr. Logan by the collar,
and therefore, it was he who had struck the first
blow. There was some execrable haggling as to
whether Mr. Hayes Fisher or Mr. Logan should make the
first apology&mdash;execrable, I say, because a gentleman never
ought to haggle over an apology if he feels that he has been
in the wrong, and because nobody could deny that Mr.
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252" class="pagenum" title="Page 252"></a>
Fisher had been the original wrongdoer. The result was
that when Mr. Gladstone came into the House on July 31st,
and was asked questions about the business, the Old Man,
for once, found himself in a difficulty. He had been told
that apologies were going to be made; but Mr. Fisher made
no sign, and, indeed, it looked very much as if he would do
nothing at all. Labby intervened at this psychological
moment by reading that extract from the account in the
<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> which fixed Mr. Fisher's responsibility
under his own hand, and it was seen that something would
have to be done. Then&mdash;and not till then&mdash;did Mr. Fisher
speak and make his apology. Mr. Logan&mdash;who had very
properly refused to take the initiative&mdash;then made a very
brief but a very handsome explanation of what he had done,
and after a few lofty words from Mr. Gladstone and the
Speaker the matter was allowed to drop into the dark abyss
of oblivion. But we can't forget it.</p>

<div class="sn">Messrs.
McCorquodale &amp; Co.</div>

<p>On August 3rd there was a most instructive and important
little debate on a Labour question. It had
reference to the dismissal by the firm of the
McCorquodales of several trade unionists. Suffice
it to say, that the chief opposition to the claims of Labour
came from Sir James Fergusson, whose remarks were
ardently cheered by the Tories; and that Sir John Hibbert
was finally pressed by Sir Charles Dilke into a promise which
binds the Government practically to refuse contracts in future
to any firm which acts like the McCorquodales. It was a
great victory for Labour&mdash;not the less great because it was
all so quietly done.</p>

<div class="sn">A Government
defeat.</div>

<p>There was a curious little incident on the following day&mdash;nothing
less than a defeat of the Government.
It arose on a small local Irish Bill. Blackrock
is a small seaside place just outside Dublin. The
Tories, who occupy a good many of the villas, have kept the
whole government of the place in their hands by maintaining
a high property qualification for votes for the Town
Com<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253" class="pagenum" title="Page 253"></a>missioners.
On this day they brought forward a Bill; but
it was opposed until they had mended their ways with regard
to the government of the town. Mr. Morley, acting on the
official view, urged that the Bill might be passed and this
other question dealt with separately, but the Irish refused to
be pacified, they went to a division, and with the aid of the
Radicals they managed to defeat the Government by nine
votes. They celebrated the event by a hearty cheer.</p>

<div class="sn">And so to
the end.</div>

<p>The penultimate week in August went on&mdash;wearily,
tamely, and monotonously. It was, perhaps, the
presence of the Speaker&mdash;it was, perhaps, the
painful recollection of the scene of violence on a
previous occasion&mdash;it was, perhaps, the universal exhaustion
of the House; whatever the cause, the excitement on the night
of August 25th was infinitely below what anybody would have
expected. Throughout the whole evening there was exactly
the same spectacle as on previous evenings&mdash;that is to say,
there was the same old obstructive group discussing exactly
the same topics; raising the same objections; going into the
same subtleties as if the Bill were just in its first stage; and
there was the same dreary and universal emptiness of the
House generally. At last, as eleven o'clock approached, the
Unionists prepared themselves for a dramatic effort. Mr.
Chamberlain prepared an educational bombshell, but Mr.
Healy hoisted the engineer with his own petard.</p>

<p>Then, quietly and noiselessly, we went through a couple of
divisions; and before we knew where we were, Mr. Morley was
standing at the table, and moving that the third reading of the
Bill should take place the following Wednesday. Nearly
every one of the most prominent debaters had by this time
cleared out. The Irish Benches, however, remained full, and
from them came a triumphant cheer as, at a quarter to twelve,
the motion was carried, and the second stage of the great
measure of Irish emancipation was completed.</p>

<h3>IRELAND'S CHARTER THROUGH.</h3>


<div class="sn">A dull beginning.</div>

<p>Insipidity, weariness, and dulness marked the commencement
of the concluding week of the Home Rule
Bill in the House. There was no private business
on the Monday, and accordingly for nearly a
quarter of an hour&mdash;it seemed infinitely longer to the little
group of members present&mdash;the House sat in sedate and
solemn silence. Then commenced questions, and in a moment
half-a-dozen members were buzzing with gnat-like pertinacity
about the impassive figure of the Postmaster-General. Mr.
Arnold Morley was continually on his legs. For instance,
Mr. Bousfield wanted to know what rule there was which
forbade Post Office employ&eacute;s to approach the House of
Commons directly, or to sign a petition to the House with
reference to any grievance, after having unsuccessfully
petitioned the Postmaster-General. Mr. Morley replied
laconically, &quot;There is no such rule.&quot; Then several of the
Tory members attempted to corner Sir U.K. Shuttleworth
about the quantity of coals consumed in the
&quot;Majestic&quot; while going at full speed. Sir Edward Harland
was cautious, and Mr. Gibson Bowles, whose rising was
the signal for derisive cheers, was pertinacious. The
Secretary to the Admiralty, always dignified, was grave
and serious. He was not to be tripped up, and discreetly
declined to be drawn.</p>

<div><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255" class="pagenum" title="Page 255"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Our first
line of
defence.</div>

<p>It is one of the well-known peculiarities of the House of
Commons that its attendance is usually in inverse
line of proportion to the importance of the subject which
it is discussing. On August 28th the House was
engaged in debating the question which above all others ought
to interest the people of this country&mdash;the state, namely, of
our Navy. Yet the House was almost entirely empty throughout
the whole evening, and the speeches were generally
confined to the somewhat inarticulate representatives of the
services, and to the dullest and smallest men in the whole
assembly. It is obviously inconvenient&mdash;perhaps it is even
perilous&mdash;that interests so grave and so gigantic should fall
for their guardianship into hands so incompetent and so petty.
It may be an inevitable accompaniment of our Parliamentary
system that the naval debates should be so conducted; if so,
one must put it down as one of the evils which must be taken
as part of the price we pay for the excellences of a representative
system.</p>

<div class="sn">Sir Edward
Reed as an
alarmist.</div>

<p>I may dismiss the debate on the Navy with one or two
further observations. Sir Edward Reed, though he
knows a good deal about ships&mdash;for he has had
something to do with them all his life&mdash;is not an
authority whom one can implicitly accept. He is not a
politician who has prospered according to what he believes
and what are doubtless his deserts, for he is a very clever man,
and politicians who are a little disappointed have a certain
tendency to ultra-censoriousness, which damages the effectiveness
and prejudices the authority of their criticisms. Thus,
Sir Edward has been always more or less of a pessimist with
regard to the doings of other men. On August 28th he spoke
in decidedly alarmist terms of the lessons which should be
taught to us by the loss of the &quot;Victoria.&quot; Speaking with the
modesty of a mere layman on the subject, I should have been
inclined to think that the chief moral to be drawn from that
terrible and tragic disaster was the terribly important part
which the mere personality of the individual in command still
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256" class="pagenum" title="Page 256"></a>
plays in deciding the fate of hundreds of lives; that, in short,
the personal equation&mdash;as it has come to be called&mdash;- is still the
supreme and decisive factor in all naval enterprises. But
there may be some grounds for the alarmist views of Sir
Edward Reed, and I see no reason why his views should not
receive prompt, candid, and independent investigation. The
officials may oppose such an investigation; but officials are
always optimists, and the cold draught of outside criticism
does them an immense deal of good.</p>

<div class="sn">The Grand
Old Chieftain
and his
tactics.</div>

<p>At an early hour in the evening there was a very significant
question, and an equally significant answer.
Sir Charles Dilke called attention, with characteristic
adroitness to a weapon which the Tories
placed in our hands for dealing with such an
emergency as that by which we were at the moment confronted.
It was Lord Salisbury who made the most excellent
suggestion that when a Bill had gone through all its stages
in one Session of Parliament it should not be necessary to
repeat the process in the next, but that a mere resolution
should bring the Bill once again into the fulness of life. Would
it not be possible for the Government, asked Sir Charles, to
adopt the proposal with regard to their measures? The answer
of the Old Man was cautious, vague, and dilatory. It is one of
his well-known peculiarities not to arrive at the solution of a
tactical difficulty one moment too soon; and this is a rule
which, generally speaking, acts extremely well. I dare say
Sir Charles Dilke did not expect any other answer; and
nobody in the House was surprised that the Old Man
answered as he did. But all the same, one could read
between the lines, and it was pretty clear that the Old Man
was preparing to face the situation by remedies drastic
enough to meet even so revolutionary a situation.</p>

<div class="sn">A great Parliamentarian.</div>

<p>Everybody was delighted&mdash;that is to say, everybody
on the Liberal side of the House&mdash;to see that
the great old leader was displaying on this
question the same unerring tactics, the same resources
<a name="Page_257" id="Page_257" class="pagenum" title="Page 257"></a>
the same willingness to learn, and the same elasticity of
mind as he has manifested throughout his whole life&mdash;or at
least throughout all that part of it which dates from his
escape from the shackles of his early and obscurantist creed.
He has never concealed the fact that he departed from the
old rules of the House of Commons with misgiving reluctance,
and even repulsion. It would have been strange, indeed, if
he could have felt otherwise after all his long years of glorious
service in that august assembly. But then, when the time
did come for taking the plunge, he took it boldly and unshrinkingly.
It was a delight to watch him during this
Session, and especially when it became necessary to use the
guillotine against the revolutionary and iniquitous attempt to
paralyse the House of Commons by sheer shameless obstruction.
The &quot;guillotine&quot; was a most serious, a most
momentous, and even portentous departure from all precedent,
except, of course, the Tory precedent of 1887; but the
Old Man, when the proper time came, proposed the experiment
with the utmost composure&mdash;with that splendid command
of nerve&mdash;that lofty and dauntless courage&mdash;that
indifference to attack, which explains his extending hold over
the imaginations and the hearts of men.</p>

<div class="sn">The plain
duty of
Liberals.</div>

<p>I have little doubt that he will be quite equal to any
further steps which may be necessary to vindicate
the authority of the majority in the House of
Commons, and nobody doubts that such further
steps may be necessary. The real and fundamental question&mdash;as
I put it over and over again&mdash;is whether the Liberal
party and the Liberal majority shall go before the country at
the next election with the charge made good against them of
lack of will, competence, and energy. If once that charge
can be substantiated, I regard the Liberal cause as lost&mdash;and
lost for many a year to come. Any Government almost is
better than a Government which cannot govern; and the
sentiment is so universal that I have no doubt the shifting
ballast, which decides all elections, would go with a rush to
<a name="Page_258" id="Page_258" class="pagenum" title="Page 258"></a>
the Tory side, and would enthrone in the place of power a
strong Tory majority and an almost omnipotent Tory Government.
The Tories know this, and calculate upon it, and will
devote all their energies, therefore to reducing the present
House of Commons and the present Ministry to discredited
impotence, contemptible paralysis. Such a conspiracy must
be met in the proper manner. Obstructive debate must be
mercilessly closured; old rules must be abandoned without a
sigh, and give way to others more adapted to the necessity of
the time. Above all things the House of Lords must be
flouted, humiliated, and defied. It is on the spring-tide of
popular democratic and anti-aristocratic passion we shall
have to float the next Liberal Government into power.</p>

<div class="sn">Nepotism in
the army.</div>

<p>When business commenced on August 29th, there was a
beggarly array of empty benches. For some
time, the only Tory defenders of the Constitution
were the ubiquitous George Christopher Trout
Bartley and the valiant Howard Vincent. Questions showed
more inclination than ever to wander into the purely
parochial. Presently Mr. Burnie came along with an inquiry
addressed to the War Minister whether it was correct
the Duke of Connaught had been appointed to the chief
command of the army at Aldershot; and, if so, on what
grounds he had been selected for this important position.
Several other vigorous Radicals were on the same scent.
Mr. Campbell-Bannerman said it was quite true the Duke
had become Commander-in-Chief. This was because of his
fitness; because he was practically the senior officer available,
and because he had gained experience in both
regimental and staff duties, having filled with great credit
the high office of Commander-in-Chief at Bombay. Herculean
Mr. Allan, of Gateshead, sought for information how
many months the Duke of Connaught was absent from his
duties when he commanded at Portsmouth. Young Mr.
Dalziel also came forward, wanting to know whether the
Duke would receive the salary of a General or a
Lieutenant-<a name="Page_259" id="Page_259" class="pagenum" title="Page 259"></a>General.
Mr. A.C. Morton, who had appropriated for the
nonce Mr. T.W. Russell's usual seat, was anxious for a
further explanation of what was meant by the Duke being
practically the senior officer available. He also wanted
to know what experience he had had in real fighting.
The reply of the War Minister was conciliatory. There
were, he explained, one or two generals senior to H.R.H.,
but who were at present discharging duties from which it
was not desirable they should be removed. The pay would
be that of a Lieutenant-General. Owing to domestic circumstances,
the Duke lived out of Portsmouth, but he was
little out of the district he commanded. He served in the
Egyptian campaign, which was the only opportunity he had
had during his career in taking part in active warfare.
This did not satisfy either Mr. Allan or Mr. Morton. The
member for Peterboro' wanted to be precise. How far was
H.R.H. away from the real fighting? The War Minister
could only smile and shake his head. Mr. Allan expressed
his dissent, and Mr. Morton, derisively cheered by a handful
of Tories, solemnly begged to give notice that on the Army
Estimates he would again raise the question of this flagrant
job.</p>

<div class="sn">A triumph
for Mr.
Burns.</div>

<p>The evening was notable for a splendid triumph achieved
by that fine Democrat, John Burns. It arose
out of the Navy Estimates. The conditions of
labour in the Government dockyards have long
been crying out for remedy, and Mr. Burns presented the
case for the men with a force and lucidity that carried conviction
home to the minds of a crowded House, among
whose members his is one of the most magnetic personalities.
The member for Battersea pointed out that, whilst
he strongly approved of the attitude of the Government in
adding &pound;30,000 to the wages of the men, the real step
they should have taken was to ignore the opinion of the
permanent officials, those bugbears of all reformers, past,
present, and to come&mdash;pay the trades union rates, and
<a name="Page_260" id="Page_260" class="pagenum" title="Page 260"></a>
abolish classification altogether. A very excellent smack at
Sir John Gorst, Mr. A.B. Forwood, and other standbacks
on the Opposition side was the remark:&mdash;&quot;I would rather
have the rate of wages in dockyards regulated by trades unions
than made the sport of party politicians and put up as a kind
of Dutch auction.&quot; What have the Government to fear in this
matter? The trade unions must always have to face competition
and trade rivalry, and these elements alone are more
than sufficient to keep down wages. So great was the
impression made by Mr. Burns's speech, that official notice
of it was inevitable, and Mr. E. Robertson was able to make
an announcement which gave, if not absolute satisfaction,
at least a measure of it to the champions of the artificers
and labourers in our dockyards.</p>

<div class="sn">Home Rule
again.</div>

<p>It was only the Old Man would have had the daring to
begin the third stage of the greatest Bill of
modern times at an hour so inauspicious&mdash;noon
on a Wednesday sitting. Everybody knows that
among all the dead hours of the House of Commons, there
is no hour so utterly dead as that. Indeed, very often such
is the disinclination of the natural man for unreasonable
and unseasonable hours&mdash;it is very often extremely difficult
for the Whips of the Government to get together the forty
members who are necessary to form the quorum for the
starting of business; and I have known cases where it was
close upon two o'clock&mdash;if not even later&mdash;before there was
a sufficient muster for the beginning of the day's business.
However, Mr. Gladstone calculated correctly on the magic of
his name and the witchery of his oratory; for by a few
minutes past twelve, when he rose to make his speech, the
House was crowded in almost every part, and he had an
audience not only unprecedented in its fulness at such an hour,
but also delightfully stimulating in its general responsiveness
and sometimes even its ready enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="sn">A mighty
speech.</div>

<p>The speech of the Old Man was worthy of the occasion.
For some hours after it had ended nobody had anything to
<a name="Page_261" id="Page_261" class="pagenum" title="Page 261"></a>
say about anybody or anything else; it was one of those
speeches that create something like rapture;
and that oft-repeated declaration that he had
never done anything like it before&mdash;a declaration I
have heard too many times to now altogether accept. The
voice was splendid, the diction very fine, the argument close
and well knit, the matter carefully prepared without any
selfish adherence to the letter of a manuscript&mdash;a fidelity
which always spoils anything like spontaneity of oratory.
And the Old Man was in splendid physical condition and in
the brightest of spirits. Indeed, I was never more struck
with the extraordinary physical perfection which Mr. Gladstone's
frame has maintained after his eighty-three years of
full active and wearing life. The back was straight, the
figure erect, the motions free, unconstrained, easy; the gestures
those of a man whose every joint moved easily in a
fresh and vigorous frame. And the face was wonderfully
expressive, now darkened with passionate hatred of wrong,
now bursting into the sunshine of genial and pleasant smiles.
And&mdash;as is usual when he is in this mood&mdash;he was extraordinarily
quick at taking interruptions; he was, indeed,
almost boisterous in his manner, and seemed to positively
invite those interjectional interventions from the other side,
which, in less exuberant moods he is sometimes inclined to
resent. Mr. Chaplin had quoted a portentous passage from
Cavour to show that the great Italian statesman had declared
against Home Rule. Mr. Gladstone was able to cap this
with another passage&mdash;which, beginning with a strong indictment
of English methods of government in Ireland, wound
up with the declaration that Ireland ought to be treated with
the same justice and generosity as Canada. While the
Liberals were still cheering this thrust, Mr. Chaplin got up
to make the remark that Cavour had said other things quite
contradictory of this, whereupon the Old Man&mdash;still with a
smile of deadly courtesy&mdash;pounced upon Mr. Chaplin with
the remark, &quot;Is it your case, then, that Cavour contradicted
<a name="Page_262" id="Page_262" class="pagenum" title="Page 262"></a>
himself?&quot;&mdash;a retort, the rapidity and completeness of which
crushed Mr. Chaplin for the moment.</p>

<div class="sn">Cowed
silence of
the Tories.</div>

<p>When he dealt with the charge that the Government had
unduly curtailed debate, the Old Man had made
up his case very thoroughly, and as he read the
damning indictment which showed the wild multitudinousness,
the infinite variety and the prolonged duration
of the speeches of the Opposition, there was plenty of
encouraging cheers from the Liberal side; while on the
Tory Benches they sat in dumb and stricken silence. Indeed,
throughout the whole speech, the Tories were singularly
quiet. Perhaps it was that they too were carried away by
the witchery and the spell which the Old Man had cast over
the rest of the House; and, while disagreeing with him,
were still sufficiently wound up to the lofty and more empyrean
heights which the orator reached to feel that there
would be something jarring and even common in a note of
dissent. Whatever the reason, they remained uncommonly
silent throughout the whole speech; and, sometimes, when
one or two of the more ebullient members spoke, the interjectors
got very little change for their pains.</p>

<div class="sn">The readiness
of the
Old Man.</div>

<p>And this silence was the more remarkable in one or two
of the most important passages of the Bill, for
the Old Man challenged interruption. Thus he
ranged the objections to the Bill under seven
separate heads, and then he proceeded to read out these
heads. They were all a perfectly faithful representation&mdash;in
some cases even a repetition&mdash;of what the Tories had said; but
stated baldly, nakedly, in the cold light of early day, they
sounded intensely ridiculous. It was impossible, for instance,
to take seriously the resounding proposition that the Bill
&quot;would break up the Empire&quot;&mdash;that under the Bill the
loyal minority would incur loss of life, liberty and property,
and so on. As Mr. Gladstone read out these propositions
there was a deadly chill, a disheartened silence, on the Tory
Benches which had its importance, for it showed plainly that,
<a name="Page_263" id="Page_263" class="pagenum" title="Page 263"></a>
however ready they were to mouth these things on platforms
they felt a little ashamed of them in their more sober
moments. Just once or twice, a stray Tory did venture to
signify by a timid and faint cheer his acceptance of the
ridiculous litany of prophecy and reprobation which Mr.
Gladstone was repeating to him. And then the Old Man
was delightful; he smiled all over his face until its features
were one vast mass of corrugated wrinkles; then he waved
his hand a little to the other side, and finally congratulated
himself on being in the happy position of being even partially
corroborated by gentlemen of opposite opinions, Whereupon,
of course, the whole House laughed, including the very
member whom the Old Man had thus toasted. In short, as
will have been seen from my description, the Old Man was
in his very best form, in full command of himself, of his
friends, and even of his enemies.</p>

<div class="sn">A solemn
peroration.</div>

<p>Finally, there came a peroration&mdash;lofty, almost
inspired&mdash;splendidly delivered, rapturously applauded. It
rang out a note of perfect confidence&mdash;of early
and complete victory&mdash;of righteous trust in a
righteous cause. And the House which had followed the
great orator in rapt attention so long could not tire of
cheering this glowing and inspiring end. For several minutes
the cheers were given&mdash;and again given, and again. Meantime,
poor Mr. Courtney had been standing&mdash;waiting for
silence. To him had been entrusted the task of moving the
rejection of the measure. He was dull, pedantic, and rather
embarrassed after this great effort of Mr. Gladstone, and the
House emptied. There was a certain stir of curiosity as the
name of &quot;Mr. Disraeli&quot; was called by the Speaker; and
then the bearer of one of the greatest names of our times,
stood up. His speech was brightish, cleverish, and yet there
was something wanting. Mr. Redmond was critical, cautious,
severe on the financial clauses, but finally pronounced for the
Bill. And so we started the first day of final debate on the
Home Rule Bill.</p>

<div><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264" class="pagenum" title="Page 264"></a></div>
<div class="sn">The last
lap.</div>

<p>There was no doubt about it; the House was thoroughly
jaded, and it would have been beyond the power
of the most Demosthenic orator to rouse it to
anything like enthusiasm. Several of the
speeches throughout the following evening were of a
high order; but still there was no response&mdash;it was
speaking from a rock to the noisy, unlistening, and irresponsive
sea. The night of September 1st began with a
brief, graceful, finely-phrased and finely-tempered speech by
Mr. Justin McCarthy, which confirmed Mr. Dillon's frank
expression of the Bill as a final measure of emancipation to
the Irish people. The obvious sincerity of the speaker&mdash;the
high character he has, his long consistency, and, above all,
the sense of his thorough unselfishness, procured for Mr.
McCarthy a respectful and even a sympathetic hearing from
all parts of the House, and he had an audience silent, attentive,
and admiring.</p>

<div class="sn">Joe's parting
bolt.</div>

<p>The contrast between the kindliness, the sincere judgment,
and the kindly disposition of Mr. McCarthy
and the somewhat raucous and malevolent
accents of Mr. Chamberlain, was very marked.
Not that Mr. Chamberlain was by any means so nasty as
usual; it looked as if he had been taught by the failure of
his last utterance into learning at last that malevolence in
the end defeats itself by its very excess, and he evidently had
resolved to put a very severe restraint upon himself, and
attuned his oratory to a very minor key. But this new tone
was just as unsuccessful as the other, and there is a second
unsuccessful and flat speech to be put to his credit. Many
of the ideas, many of the phrases, were repetitions of things
he had already said a hundred times over in the course of
the previous debates; in short, the speech was a revelation
of the fact, known to those who have watched Mr. Chamberlain
carefully, that the soil is very barren and very thin; and
that after a few oratorical crops it becomes exhausted. Perhaps
the failure of the speech was also largely due to the
<a name="Page_265" id="Page_265" class="pagenum" title="Page 265"></a>
fact that the Irish and the Liberal members, taught by
previous experiences, resolved to also put restraint on themselves.
They have learned by this time that interruptions do
Mr. Chamberlain a great deal of good; and that his great
nimbleness and readiness never come out so well as when he
has suddenly to answer such an interruption. Addressing
benches&mdash;blank, silent and irresponsive, he laboured rather
heavily throughout the whole of his address; and there was
a complete absence even from the Tory benches of that loud
and frequent accompaniment of cheers to which Mr. Chamberlain
is usually treated. In short, it was a dull, ineffective
speech, mostly listened to in silence.</p>

<div class="sn">A coming
man.</div>

<p>Sir Edward Grey delivered an admirable reply. In his
case&mdash;as in that of Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;there was
an immense disadvantage of a tired House, and
the audience had thinned somewhat after Mr.
Chamberlain had sat down. But those who remained were
fortunate enough to hear one of the most perfect specimens
of House of Commons eloquence that has been heard in
Westminster for many a day. Indeed, there are few men in
the House who have so perfect a command of what I might
call the true, genuine, and even grand style of Parliamentary
eloquence. Sir Edward Grey speaks with a perfectly unbroken,
level tone; his language is moderate and reserved, and he
has the great art of using language which implies and
suggests more than it actually says. In short, his eloquence
is that of perfect high-bred conversation, discussing
questions with that complete self-command and composure
of the man of the world who disdains to use, even of the
greatest affairs, and of the strongest emotions, language of
passion or exaggeration. Such a style is wonderfully effective
in a business assembly, where men feel, even when they
are under the glow of splendid eloquence, that there is behind
the words a thinking, reflective, and composed mind. The
speech gained enormously by the contrast of its composure&mdash;its
fine temper, its calm and broad judgment&mdash;from the somewhat
<a name="Page_266" id="Page_266" class="pagenum" title="Page 266"></a>
pettish, personal, and passionate utterances of Mr.
Chamberlain. This young man will go very far&mdash;very far
indeed.</p>

<div class="sn">Wearisome
Wallace wit.</div>

<p>Then there was the interval of the dinner-hour&mdash;wound
up with a speech from Mr. Wallace. The iniquity
of the abandonment of the In-and-Out clause of
the Bill was again the burden of his theme. He
brought to the subject the same quaint, rich, but somewhat
elaborate humour which made the success of his previous
speech; and the Tories were more than delighted with some
telling hits which he gave to Mr. Gladstone for the change of
front. But Mr. Wallace made two mistakes. It is not given
to any man to make a success twice over on the same theme;
and he spoke at much too great a length. In the end he
somewhat wearied the House, and altogether the second
speech was not equal to the first, though it had a great deal
of ability in it, and <i>The Sun</i> was obliged next day to acknowledge
with gratitude the great gratuitous advertisement which
it received by numerous quotations from its columns.</p>

<div class="sn">Balfour at a
disadvantage.</div>

<p>It was half-past ten o'clock when Mr. Balfour rose. By
this time the heat, which had set in with quite
tropical fervour, became almost overpowering,
and the House, which began by being tired, had
become almost exhausted. It was under these depressing
circumstances that the Leader of the Opposition started on
what must have been to him something of a corv&eacute;e, and for
a considerable time&mdash;although the speech was not wanting
in some very telling hits and bright sayings&mdash;he laboured
very heavily; he could not arouse the enthusiasm even of
his own followers, and was thus wire-drawn and ineffective.</p>

<div class="sn">Honest John
in fighting
form.</div>

<p>If Mr. Balfour was at his worst, Mr. Morley was at his
best. The speech which he delivered at Newcastle,
during the previous week, placed Mr.
Morley definitely in the very front rank of platform
orators. After his speech of September 1st, he made a
distinct and great advance in his position as a Parliamentary
<a name="Page_267" id="Page_267" class="pagenum" title="Page 267"></a>
debater. His great defect as a speaker has been a certain
want of nimbleness and readiness. He has infinitely wider
and larger resources than Mr. Chamberlain, who, nevertheless,
excels in the alertness which is often the accompaniment
of shallowness. On this occasion Mr. Morley was rapid,
prompt, crushing. As thus: Mr. Balfour had spoken of the
people who denounced Dublin Castle as &quot;third-rate politicians.&quot;
&quot;Who is the third-rate politician?&quot; asked Mr.
Morley, looking towards Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;everybody knows
that he used to denounce Dublin Castle&mdash;and peal on peal of
laughter and cheers followed from the Liberal and Irish
Benches. Mr. Morley followed up his advantage by saying,
with a comic air of despair, &quot;It is very awkward to have
coadjutors using this kind of language about each other.&quot;</p>

<div class="sn">A reminiscence
of 1885.</div>

<p>This is just the kind of thing which rouses even the most
tired of the House; there was an immediate rise
the temperature; the Liberals and the Irish
were ready to delightedly cheer; the Tories, who
always get restive as they approach the final hour of defeat,
grew noisy, rude, and disorderly. Then Mr. Morley turned
to the charges against the Irish members, and asked the
Tories if their own record was so white and pure that they
could afford to throw stones. This brought an allusion to
the Tory-Parnellite alliance of 1885, which always disturbs,
distracts, and even infuriates the Tories. They became restless
and noisy, and Mr. Balfour and Mr. Goschen began to
rise and explain. Well would it have been for Mr.
Goschen had he resisted this inclination. Mr. Morley was
alluding to the Newport speech of Lord Salisbury, and Mr.
Balfour was defending it. &quot;Ah, but,&quot; said Mr. Morley,
&quot;did you not&quot;&mdash;meaning Mr. Goschen&mdash;&quot;did you not yourself
attack Lord Salisbury for that very speech?&quot;&mdash;a retort
that produced a tempest of cheers. There were then some
scornful and contemptuous allusions to Mr. Russell&mdash;to his
stale vituperation, and, above all, to his grotesque charge
against Mr. Morley of making himself the tool of clericalism.
<a name="Page_268" id="Page_268" class="pagenum" title="Page 268"></a>
&quot;There are more kinds of clericalism than one,&quot; said Mr.
Morley, alluding to the violent partisanship of the Presbyterian
clergymen of South Tyrone. Finally, the speech
ended in a lofty, splendid, and impressive peroration. When
tracing the progress of the cause for the last seven years, Mr.
Morley spoke with the fine poetic diction in which he stands
supreme, of &quot;starless skies&quot; and a &quot;tragic hour&quot;&mdash;meaning
the Parnell crisis&mdash;and then he used the words which more
than any other thrilled the House. &quot;We have,&quot; he cried,
&quot;an indomitable and unfaltering captain,&quot; and cheer on cheer
rose, while the Old Man sat, white, silent, with a composed
though rapt look.</p>

<p>There was the bathos of a poor speech from Colonel
Nolan, and then the division. Everybody has the numbers
now&mdash;34 majority&mdash;34 in spite of Saunders and Bolton, of
absent Wallace, and unpaired Mr. Wilson. We cheer, counter
cheer; we rise and wave our hats; and then quickly, quietly,
even with a subdued air, we walk out and leave the halls of
Parliament silent, dark, and echoless.</p>

<h3>HOME RULE IN THE LORDS.</h3>


<div class="sn">A brilliant
scene.</div>

<p>The brilliancy of the scene in the House of Lords on September
4th, when the fight over the Home Rule
Bill began, was undeniable. Standing at the bar,
in that small space which is reserved for members
of the other Chamber, and looking out at the view, it was, I
thought, one of the most picturesque and brilliant spectacles
on which my eye had ever rested. The beauty of the House
of Commons is great. But it is undoubtedly inferior in
beauty to the House of Lords. In the House of Commons
the roof is a false one, for the original loftiness of the ceiling
was found too great to allow anyone to be properly heard.
But in the House of Lords, where the acoustic properties are
still extremely bad, the anxiety to hear its members has not
yet proved great enough to induce them to make any change
in the roof, with the result that the Chamber gives you an
impression of loftiness, spaciousness, and sweep, such as you
do not find in the other. And then the walls at the end
obtain additional splendour from the fine pictures that there
stand out and confront you&mdash;pictures full of crowded life,
movement, and tragedy. The Throne, too, with all its
gilded splendour, remains, even in its emptiness, a reminder
of that stately and opulent lordship which our institutions
give to a great personage above all parties and all
classes.</p>

<div><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270" class="pagenum" title="Page 270"></a></div>
<div class="sn">Lovely
woman.</div>

<p>In addition to all this, the House of Lords has made provision
for the appearance of lovely woman, which
contrasts most favourably with the curmudgeon
and churlish arrangements of the House of Commons.
In the House of Commons women have to hide
themselves, as though they were in a Mahommedan country,
behind a grille&mdash;where, invisible, suffocated, and crowded,
they are permitted to see&mdash;themselves unseen&mdash;the gambollings
of their male companions below. In the House of
Lords, on the other hand, there is a gallery all round the
house, in which peeresses and the relatives of peers are
allowed to sit&mdash;observed of all men&mdash;prettily dressed, attentive&mdash;a
beautiful flower-bordering, so to speak, to the male
assemblage below. The variety and brilliancy of colour given
by their fashionable clothes adds a great richness and
opulence and lightness to the scene; in fact, takes away anything
like sombreness, in appearance and aspect at least,
from an assembly which otherwise is calculated to suggest
sinister reminiscences of coming trouble and the approaching
darkness of political agitation. The benches, too, have a
richness which is foreign to the House of Commons, as the
members of the popular assembly sit on benches covered with
a deep green leather, which is dark, modest, and unpretentious.
There is always something, to my eye at least,
that suggests opulence in the colour crimson, and the benches
of the Upper Chamber are all in crimson leather, and the
crimson has all the freshness which comes from rarity of use.
In the House of Commons, with all its workaday and
industrious life, the deep and dark green has always more or
less of a worn and shabby look. In the Upper Chamber the
original splendour of the crimson cloth is undimmed; for
most of the benches remain void and unoccupied for
999 nights of the thousand on which their lordships
meet.</p>

<div class="sn">The two chambers&mdash;a
contrast.</div>

<p>Whatever the cause I always associate the House of Lords
in my mind with emptiness and silence, and the gloomy scenes
<a name="Page_271" id="Page_271" class="pagenum" title="Page 271"></a>
of desertion. And, therefore, when I see it crowded as it was
on this historic Monday evening, the effect it
produces is heightened by the recollection and the
sense of the contrast it presents to its ordinary
appearance. The House of Commons has a certain impressiveness
and splendour of air when it is very full; I
always have a certain sense of exaltation by the mere looking
at its crowded benches on these nights when the excitement
of the hour brings everybody to his place. But then the
House of Commons is frequently full, and there is no such
sense of unusualness when you see it thus that you have
when you look on the House of Lords with benches teeming
with multitudinous life which you have seen so often empty,
lifeless, and ghostly. Thus splendid was the scene, and yet it
gave you a prevailing and unconquerable impression of gloom
and lifelessness. In the House of Commons, the member
addressing the assembly is like the wind which passes through
an &AElig;olian harp. You cannot utter a word which does not
produce its full and immediate response. You say a thing
which has the remotest approach to an absurdity in it, and
the whole House laughs consumedly and immediately. You
utter a phrase which excites party feeling, and at once&mdash;quick
as lightning falls&mdash;comes back the retort of anger or approval;
your way is studded and punctuated with some response or
other, that signifies the readiness and the depth and amplitude
of emotion in one of the most emotional, and noisy, and
responsive assemblies in the world. It is a curious change
from all this to look on all these crowded benches sitting in a
silence that is unbroken more than once in the course of half
an hour.</p>

<div class="sn">Spencer's
serene
courage.</div>

<p>I have often had to admire Lord Spencer&mdash;to admire him
when he was a political foe as well as when he has
been a political friend; but I don't think I ever
admired him so much as when he stood up on
September 4th to address this strange assembly. Hours he
has passed through of all-pervading and all-surrounding gloom,
<a name="Page_272" id="Page_272" class="pagenum" title="Page 272"></a>
danger, and assassination; but I do not suppose his nerve
was ever put to a test more trying than when he confronted
those large battalions of uncompromising and irresponsive
foes. There were foes on all sides of him. They filled the
many benches opposite to him; they filled, with equal fervour
and multitudinousness, the benches on his own side. It was
remarkable to see the thoroughness with which the Tories
had mustered their forces; but the spectacle of the Liberal
Unionists' Benches was even still more remarkable, for there
was not a seat vacant; they had all come&mdash;those renegade and
venomous deserters from the Liberal ranks&mdash;to do their utmost
against the Liberal party and their mighty Liberal leader.
And what support had Lord Spencer against all these foes&mdash;before
him, around him&mdash;on all sides of him? On the
benches immediately behind him there was a small band of
men&mdash;not forty all told&mdash;looking strangely deserted, skeleton-like,
even abashed in all their loneliness and isolation. These
were the friends&mdash;few but faithful&mdash;amid all the hundreds,
who alone had a word of cheer for Lord Spencer in a long
and trying speech he had to address to his irreconcilable foes.
But if there was any tremor in him as he stood up in surroundings
so trying, I was unable to detect it. Indeed, at
the moment he rose, there was something very fine and very
impressive in his figure. He is, as most people know, a man
of unusual height; hard exercise and the ride across country
have kept him from having any of that tendency to <i>embonpoint</i>
which destroys in middle age so many a fine figure. On the
contrary, there is not a superfluous ounce of flesh on that tall,
alert figure; it is the figure of a trained athlete rather than
the figure one would associate with a nobleman in the end of
a self-indulgent and ever-eating and over-drinking century.
The features, strong yet gentle, though far from regular, have
considerable distinction, and the flowing red beard makes the
face stand out in any assembly. Carefully but plainly dressed,
erect, perfectly composed, and courteous in every word and
look and gesture, Lord Spencer made his plea for justice to
<a name="Page_273" id="Page_273" class="pagenum" title="Page 273"></a>
the nation where once his name was the symbol for hatred
and wrong.</p>

<div class="sn">A man of
deeds, not
words.</div>

<p>Lord Spencer is not an orator. Simple, unadorned,
straightforward, he speaks just as he feels; and
this lent a singular fascination to a speech which
from other lips might have sounded thin and
ineffectual, for the speech was nothing less than a revelation
into the depths of a nature singularly rich in courage and
experience. One cannot help thinking of all that lay behind
those plain and unadorned words in which Lord Spencer told
the story of his conversion from the policy of coercion to that of
self-government. Here was the man who had looked out one
summer evening on the spot where his close friend&mdash;his chief
subordinate&mdash;was hacked to death; this was the man who
had brought to conviction and then to the narrow square of
the execution yard the members of one of the most powerful
and sanguinary of conspiracies; here was the man who
for years had passed through the streets of Dublin and the
towns of Ireland amid the rattle of cavalcade, as necessary
for his protection against popular hate as the troops that
protect the person of the Czar in the streets of Poland.
Here was, indeed, a man not of words but of deeds; one
who spoke not mere phrases coined from the imaginings of
the brain, but one who had seen and heard and throbbed;
had looked unappalled into the depths and the abysses of
human life, and the dreadest political experiences; one who
had visited the Purgatorio and conversed with the lost or the
tortured souls, and come back from the pilgrimage with
words of hope, faith, and charity. Altogether it was a fine
speech&mdash;worthy of the man, worthy of his career, worthy of
the great and historic occasion.</p>

<div class="sn">Funereal
Devonshire.</div>

<p>I wish I could say as much of the speech of the Duke of
Devonshire. It may be that his miserable failure
was due to the fact that he is as yet unaccustomed
to the House of Lords, and that the
modesty which is undoubtedly one of his disadvantages as a
<a name="Page_274" id="Page_274" class="pagenum" title="Page 274"></a>
public speaker has not yet been overcome; but his speech
was a return to the very worst manner of his earlier days in
the House of Commons. I have heard the Duke of Devonshire
in his early manner and in his late; and his early
manner was about as detestable as a man's manner could
have been. He had a habit of sinking his voice as he approached
the end of a sentence, so that a sentence beginning
on a high note gradually sank to a moan, and a murmur, and
a gulp. The whole effect was mournful in the extreme, and
gave you a sense of the weariness and the worthlessness of
all human life such as the most eloquent ascetic could never
succeed in imparting. In the House of Lords, the Duke of
Devonshire suddenly returned to his early and bad manner,
and delivered a speech which was more like a funeral oration
than a call to arms.</p>

<div class="sn">Lord
Ribblesdale.</div>

<p>Of the remaining speeches I need say little. Lord
Brassey, in a few manly and straightforward
words, expressed his entire sympathy with the
principle of the Bill; Lord Cowper gave another
very melancholy and inaudible performance. And then came
one of the most remarkable speeches the House of Lords has
heard for some time. From the Treasury Bench there stood
a tall, slight, and rather delicate figure. The face, long,
large-featured, hatchet-shaped, was surmounted with a mass
of curling-hair; altogether, there was a suggestion of what
Disraeli looks like in that picture of him as a youth which
contrasts so strangely and sadly with the figure and the face
we all knew in his later days. This was Lord Ribblesdale.
Lord Ribblesdale holds an office in the Royal Household in
the present Administration. Up to a short time ago, he was
unknown in even the teeming ranks of noble litt&eacute;rateurs; but
an article he wrote on a conversation with the late Mr.
Parnell gave indications of a bright and apt pen, a great
power of observation, and a shrewd, impartial mind. On
Sept. 4th, he surprised the House by showing also the
possession of very rare and very valuable oratorical powers,
<a name="Page_275" id="Page_275" class="pagenum" title="Page 275"></a>
His speech was excellent in diction, was closely and calmly
reasoned, and produced an extraordinary effect, even on the
Tory side, which, beginning by a stony silence, and a certain
measure of curiosity&mdash;ended by giving an impression of
being moved, and even awed a little by this speech.
Altogether a very remarkable performance; we have not
heard the last now that we have heard the first of Lord
Ribblesdale in the fields of party oratory.</p>

<div class="sn">A striking
personality.</div>

<p>The Duke of Argyll has changed a good deal in physical
appearance during the last twenty years. There
was a time when he was was robust and squat, a
rather stout little man, with a slightly strutting
manner, head thrown back, and very fine and spacious forehead;
a head of hair as luxurious and drooping as that of
Mary Magdalene. The form has considerably shrunk with
advanced years, but not with any disadvantage, for the face,
pinched and lined though it appears, has a finer and more
intellectual look than that of earlier days. Wrong-headed&mdash;perhaps
very self-conceited&mdash;at all events, entirely left
behind by the advancing democratic tide, the Duke of Argyll
is yet always to me a sympathetic and striking figure. If he
thinks badly, at least he thinks originally. His thoughts are
his own, and nobody else's; and though he is a bitter controversialist,
at least he feels the weight and gravity of the vast
questions on which he pronounces. Above all things, he has
a touch of the divine in his oratory. He is, indeed, almost
the last inspired speaker left in the House of Lords. There
is another speaker, of whom more presently, with extraordinary
gifts, with also true oratorical powers, capable of
producing mighty effects; but with Lord Rosebery the light
is very clear and very dry; there is none of the softness and
brilliancy, and poetic and imaginative insight which are to
be found in the speeches of the Duke of Argyll. On September
6th the Duke used very vehement and some very whirling
language about Mr. Gladstone; his reading of history was all
wrong; his policy for Ireland was&mdash;to put it plainly&mdash;brutal.
<a name="Page_276" id="Page_276" class="pagenum" title="Page 276"></a>
But what cannot be forgiven to a man who has still such a
beautiful voice&mdash;who still gesticulates so beautifully&mdash;and,
above all, who is capable of rising to the height of some of the
passages in the speech on this particular Wednesday? For
instance, what could have been more beautiful than that
passage in which he put the argument that Ireland was too
near to be treated in the same way as a distant colony&mdash;the
passage in which he spoke of seeing from the Scotch Highlands
the sun shining on the cornfields and cottage windows
of Antrim?</p>

<div class="sn">Rosebery's
great
triumph.</div>

<p>On September 7th a very great event happened in the
House of Lords. The mental mastership of that
assembly was transferred from one man to
another, from the master of many legions to
the captain of a few thin and almost despised battalions. I
heard the whole of Lord Rosebery's speech, and I heard three
quarters of the speech of the Marquis of Salisbury, and no
impartial man could deny the contrast between these two
speeches on this occasion, the one being no less fine and complete,
the other no less monotonous than I have set forth. It
was not merely that Lord Salisbury proved himself vastly
inferior to Lord Rosebery in mere oratory, but the speech of
the Foreign Secretary was that of a finer speaker, and of a
more serious, intellectual, and sagacious politician.</p>

<div class="sn">A disadvantage
conquered.</div>

<p>Lord Rosebery had the disadvantage of following upon a
speaker who had reduced the House to a state of
somnolent despair. Lord Selborne has an episcopal
appearance, the manner of an author of
hymns, and the unctuous delivery of a High Church speaker.
But like most of the orators of the House of Lords, he considered
two hours was the minimum which he was entitled to
occupy, and though he spoke with wonderful briskness, for an
octogenarian, at the beginning of his observations, his voice
soon became so exhausted as to be a mere senile and inaudible
whisper. Deeper and deeper it descended, and the House was
in the blackest depths when the Foreign Secretary rose to
<a name="Page_277" id="Page_277" class="pagenum" title="Page 277"></a>
speak. Everybody knows how embarrassing and distressing
it is to an orator to have to begin by rousing an assembly that
has been thus depressed; and the difficulty was increased in
the case of Lord Rosebery by the fact that he had to address
an audience in which four hundred men were against him and
about forty in his favour; and there is no orator whose nerve
is so steady, and whose self-confidence is so complete, as not
to be depressed and weakened by such a combination of circumstances.
This is partly the reason of the lighter tone of
the earlier observations which offended some too sensitive
critics. Indeed, it might have seemed for some time as if
Lord Rosebery got up with the idea of treating the whole
business as the merest unreality of comedy; and had resolved
to signify this by refusing to treat either the House or the Bill
or himself seriously. In face of the tragedies of the Irish
sphinx&mdash;with all its centuries of brooding sorrow behind it,
this was not a tone which commended itself to the judicious.
But, then, this was a too hasty criticism. The light and almost
chaffing introduction was necessary in the highest interests of
art; for, as I have said, the House was depressed, and it was
in no mood to listen to an orator whose creed appeared to it
the merest rank treason. It was necessary to get the House
into something like receptiveness of mood before coming to
serious business; when that was done, it was time enough to
seek to impress it.</p>

<div class="sn">An oratorical
tour de force.</div>

<p>And this is just what happened. Everybody was in
really good spirits by the time Lord Rosebery
ten minutes on his legs; Lord Selborne's
unctuous dronings had disappeared into the
irrevocable and vast distances; in short, the moribund
Chamber was alive, vivacious, and receptive. And when he
had got them to this point Lord Rosebery took the serious
part of his work seriously in hand. Not that he attempted
lofty appeal. On the contrary, rarely throughout the speech
did he raise his voice above that clear, penetrating, but
eminently self-restrained tone which is the tone of a man of
<a name="Page_278" id="Page_278" class="pagenum" title="Page 278"></a>
good society, discussing the loftiest and most complex problem
with the easy and disillusioned composure of the
experienced and slightly cynical man of the world. Nay,
Lord Rosebery offended some of his critics by openly
avowing the creed of the man of the world in dealing with
the whole problem. He was careful to disown enthusiasm,
or fanaticism, or even willingness in the service of Home
Rule. It was with him simply a frigid matter of policy, a
policy to which he had been driven by the resistless evidence
of facts, the resistless logic of reason.</p>

<div class="sn">A deep-laid
purpose.</div>

<p>This frankly was an attitude which grated slightly on the
sensitive nerves of the many to whom Ireland's
emancipation&mdash;with all the sobbing centuries
which lie behind it&mdash;is a fanaticism, a faith, a
great creed; but the point to be really considered is whether
this was the tone to adopt for the purpose of carrying out the
desired end. And I am inclined to think&mdash;and some of the
hottest Irishmen I know agree with me&mdash;that this was the
very way Lord Rosebery should have spoken. And after all
it was wonderfully impressive&mdash;even to me with all I feel
about the Irish question. For the image it presented&mdash;set
forth by the physical aspect of the orator&mdash;was such as I can
imagine to be wonderfully impressive to that dull, unimaginative,
and unsentimental personage&mdash;the man of the shifting
ballast, whose almost impenetrable brain has to finally decide
this question. And the image presented to that very creature
of clay was this: &quot;Here is a man who is my Foreign
Secretary; as such, he has every day of his life to deal with
questions which affect my interests in the most direct way;
to fight for my purse, my future, my Empire; and he has
to do so with his brain matched against the brains of the
astutest men in the world&mdash;the diplomatic representatives
of other Powers. And all this he has to do with the
sense that behind the smooth language of diplomacy,
the unbroken and even voices of diplomatic representatives,
there stand ironclads and mighty armies&mdash;bloodshed,
whole<a name="Page_279" id="Page_279" class="pagenum" title="Page 279"></a>sale,
and hideous death&mdash;the tiger spirit and powers of war.
And I see that the man who has all these complex problems
to solve&mdash;these trained gamblers to watch&mdash;these sinister
Powers to confront and think of&mdash;is a man of cold temper,
of frigid understanding, of a power of calm calculation in face
of all the perils and all the emotions and all the sentiment
of the perplexing Irish problems; and to him Home Rule
has come as a set, sober choice of possible policies for the
interest of our Empire.&quot; Such an attitude&mdash;exalted by the
even, though powerful, the cold, though penetrating voice&mdash;the
face impassive and inscrutable&mdash;the eye, steady, unmoving,
and unreadable&mdash;all this, I say, was just the kind of
thing to produce an immense impression on those who are
ready only to accept Home Rule as the policy that pays best.</p>

<div class="sn">Even the
Peers impressed.</div>

<p>And certainly the House of Lords was wonderfully impressed by
this attitude. There was no applause,
except now and then from those skeleton ranks that
lay behind Lord Rosebery, but then there was in
the whole air that curious and almost audible silence&mdash;to use
a conscious paradox&mdash;which conveys to the trained ear clearer
sounds of absorption and attention than the loudest cheers.
And then you began to forget the badinage of the earlier
sentences&mdash;you forgave the frigidity and self-repression&mdash;you
became strongly fascinated by the mobile face, inscrutable
eyes, and the voice penetrated to your innermost ear; he
gave you an immense sense of a clear, masterful, and
resolute mind and character. And, finally, towards the end,
when, to a certain extent, Lord Rosebery let himself go,
there was a ring not of ordinary emotion, but of the passion
of a great Minister who was fully conscious of the Imperial
and supreme responsibility of a Foreign Minister, who was
able to look great and even complex facts straight in the
face, who had the courage to face the disagreeable solution
of a troublesome and perilous problem. And, in spite of its
lethargy, its hatred of his opinions, the House of Lords felt
this also, and there was something of awe in the silence
<a name="Page_280" id="Page_280" class="pagenum" title="Page 280"></a>
with which it listened to the ringing words of warning with
which the speech concluded. And its attitude showed more.
It was, so to speak, a soul's awakening; it was the discovery
of having found at last a man who could sway, impress, and
strike its imagination.</p>

<div class="sn">Salisbury's
signal
failure.</div>

<p>On Friday night, September 8th, Lord Salisbury had his
opportunity of undoing this great effect&mdash;of
reasserting that intellectual as well as mere
voting dictatorship which he holds in the House
of Lords; and he signally failed to rise to the occasion. I
do not like the policy of Lord Salisbury, but there is a
lucidity, a point, and sometimes a vigour in his speeches
which make them usually charming reading. It was, therefore,
with the full expectation of being interested that I
listened to him, but he drove me out of the House by the
impossibility of my keeping awake under the influence of
his dull, shallow, and disappointing speech. He began with
a little touch of nature that certainly was prepossessing.
He had brought in with him a dark-brown bottle, like the
bottle one associates with seltzer water. The fluid was
perfectly clear; it was evidently not like the strong wine
which Prince Bismarck used to require in the days when he
used to make great speeches. And Lord Salisbury, as he
poured out a draught&mdash;it looked very like Johannis water&mdash;lifted
up the bottle to the Ministers opposite with a pleasant
smile, as though to prove to them that he was not offending
against even the sternest teetotal code.</p>

<p>It was the first and the last bit of real human naturalness
in the whole speech, for Lord Salisbury's manner and
delivery are wooden, stiff, awkward and lumbering. He
stands upright&mdash;except, of course, for that heavy stoop of
the shoulders which is one of his characteristics&mdash;and rarely
moves himself one-hundredth part of an inch. The voice&mdash;even,
clear, and strong, and yet not penetrating, and
still less inspiring&mdash;rarely has a change of note; it is
delivered with the strange, curious air of a man who is
<a name="Page_281" id="Page_281" class="pagenum" title="Page 281"></a>
thinking aloud, and has forgotten the presence of any
listeners. The eyes&mdash;hidden almost amid the shaggy and
black-grey hair which covers nearly the whole face&mdash;are
never directed to any person around. They seem to gaze
into vacancy; altogether there is something curious, weird,
almost uncanny, in this great, big whale of a man, intoning
his monologue with that curious detachment of eye and
manner in the midst of a crowded, brilliant, and intensely
nervous and restless assembly of men and women.</p>

<div class="sn">The pessimism
of a
recluse.</div>

<p>And it was not to be wondered at that a speech so
delivered&mdash;a mere soliloquy&mdash;should fail to be
impressive. It was too far and away unreal&mdash;had
too little actuality to reach the poor humble
breasts that were panting for excitement and exhortation.
But once throughout it all was there a touch of that somewhat
sardonic humour that sometimes delights even Lord
Salisbury's political foes. Replying to the very clever speech
of Lord Ribblesdale, Lord Salisbury described the speech
as a confession, and all confessions, he added, were interesting,
from St. Augustine to Rousseau, from Rousseau to Lord
Ribblesdale. That, I say, was the solitary gleam. For the
rest, it was an historical essay&mdash;with very bad history and
worse conclusions; and the whole spirit was as bad as it
could be. The Irish were still the enemy such as they
appear in the bloody pages of Edmund Spenser, or in the
war proclamations and despatches of Oliver Cromwell; and
yet I cannot feel that Lord Salisbury's language could be
resented as, say, the same language would be from Mr. Chamberlain.
It all sounded so like the dreamings of a student
and recluse&mdash;discussing the problem without much passion&mdash;without
even malignity&mdash;but with that strange frankness of
the unheard and unechoed musings of the closet.</p>

<div class="sn">A muttered
soliloquy.</div>

<p>Finally, the speech also had the narrowness, shallowness,
and unreality of the hermit's soliloquy. In the main, there
was no insight. A logic-chopper, a dialectician&mdash;even in some
respects a musing philosopher&mdash;such Lord Salisbury is;
<a name="Page_282" id="Page_282" class="pagenum" title="Page 282"></a>
but breadth, depth, clear vision&mdash;of that there was not a
trace in the whole speech. And then you went
back in memory to the other speech&mdash;so clear, so
broad-directed, yet uttered by a man who looked
straight before him and all around him&mdash;who felt the presence
in his every nerve of that assembly there which he was
addressing; who lived and saw instead of dreaming&mdash;and
you could come to no other conclusion than that of the two
leaders of the House of Lords, the young man was the
statesman and the man of action as well as the orator, and
that it was worth the spending even all the weary hours of
this past week in the House of Lords to learn so much of
these great protagonists in our Parliamentary struggles.</p>

<div class="sn">Anti-climax.</div>

<p>Of other speakers I say but little. I came in during
the dinner hour to see a very little man with
what we call in Ireland a &quot;cocked&quot; nose, a
conceited mouth, and a curious mixture of the unctuousness
and benedictory manner of the pulpit and the limp twitterings
of the curate at a ladies' tea-fight. This was the head
of the Bishop of Ripon. I cannot stare for even a second
at this tiny tomtit and artificial figure, with all those lawn
sleeves and black gowns, and all the other fripperies and
draperies of the parson-peer, who is to every rational man
so grotesque and contemptible an intruder in a legislative
chamber. In the grim and crowded gallery of the personages
of an Irish Epic, such an intruder is like the thin piping
note of a tiny bird mid the carnage and shouts and roars of
a battle-field.</p>

<p>Everybody knows the result of the division: for the Bill,
41; against, 419; majority, 378. It was a conclusion that
was foregone, but the Lords themselves recognized the comic
futility of it. The attempted cheers ended in one loud,
mocking, universal laugh. And thus the curtain fell on the
historic drama of the great Home Rule Session.</p>

<p>T.P.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
